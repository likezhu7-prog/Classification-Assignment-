2,"Prognosis of male lung cancer patients with urinary cancer: a study from a national population-based analysis. Lung cancer accounts for the most cancer-related deaths in the world. Our previous study suggested the improved survival of lung cancer patients, mainly female patients, with subsequent metachronous primary breast cancer. However, whether the survival advantages of the two primaries are associated with patients' sex and the specific breast cancer is unclear. Whether male lung cancer patients with another primary may encounter the same survival advantage as female patients is also uncertain. The uncertainty hinders these patients from the potential benefit of lung cancer clinical trial. A total of 343 male lung adenocarcinoma patients with subsequent bladder papillary transitional cell carcinoma (LCBC), 1539 lung adenocarcinoma patients with prior bladder papillary transitional cell carcinoma (BCLC), 1181 lung adenocarcinoma patients with subsequent prostate adenocarcinoma (LCPC), 7426 lung adenocarcinoma patients with prior prostate adenocarcinoma (PCLC), and patients with single bladder/prostate/lung (SLC) cancer were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results. Patients were classified into simultaneous two primary cancer (sTPC), metachronous two primary cancer 1 (mTPC1), or mTPC2 groups when interval time between two cancers was within 6 months, between 7 and 60 months, or over 60 months, respectively. Propensity matching score program was executed to match the two primary cancers with single primary. Cox regression and competing risk regression were performed to identify confounders associated with all-cause and cancer-specific survival, respectively. The major cancer-related and non-cancer-related death in the two primaries were lung cancer and heart disease, respectively. Median overall survival times since lung primary of LCBC and SLC were 97 and 17 months, respectively, and incidence of all-cause and cancer-specific death in LCBC since lung malignancy was significantly lower (Coef. - 1.24, 95% CI - 1.49 to 0.99; SHR 0.42, 95% CI 0.33-0.53). Among the categorized groups, prognosis values of sTPC and mTPC2 groups were not statically different from that of the matched single lung cancer, whereas increased overall survival time and decreased incidence of all-cause and cancer-specific death relative to the matched patients were observed in mTPC1 group (H.R 0.28, 95% CI 0.19-0.41; SHR 0.33, 95% CI 0.23-0.47). Similar prognosis of LCPC relative to SLC was also observed. Furthermore, a generally improved survival relative to SLC was observed in PCLC (median survival times of PCLC and SLC were 17 and 12 months, respectively; Coef. - 0.32, 95% CI - 0.43 to 0.22; SHR 0.77, 95% CI 0.69-0.85), whereas prognosis of BCLC was similar to the matched ones. These results hinted that survival of lung cancer patients might vary with prior cancer history. Further analysis among groups with the two primaries suggested that advanced bladder cancer was not associated with prognosis of patients with LCBC and BCLC. On the contrary, advanced prostate cancer was associated with all-cause and cancer-specific death in patients with PCLC but not in patients with LCPC. Compared with patients with single lung cancer, male lung cancer patients with subsequent bladder/prostate primary over 6 months experienced generally improved survival. These results were similar to our previous study regarding female lung cancer patients with another breast primary. On the contrary, male lung cancer patients with prior primary malignancy encountered varied prognosis: improved survival relative to single lung primary was observed in lung cancer with prior prostate cancer, whereas prognosis of lung cancer with prior bladder cancer was not different. Therefore, great attention was required to characterize prognosis of lung cancer patients with another primary in advance, which was essential to eliminate the potential bias when these patients were included into the clinical trials."
2,"miR-21: a non-invasive biomarker and potential therapeutic target for lung cancer? We read with great interest the article, published in Cell Biochem Biophys, showing that serum level of miR-21 was significantly elevated in lung cancer patients compared with controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that miR-21 could differentiate lung cancer from healthy controls with an AUC (the area under the curve) of 0.85, and the optimal sensitivity and specificity were 85.7 and 86.5 %, respectively [1]. These findings suggest that miR-21 can be a potential non-invasive biomarker for lung cancer patients and miR-21 may be a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer. Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors and is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the world [2]. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80–85 % of all cases of lung cancer [3]. Despite much advances in lung cancer therapy, the survival rate for lung cancer patients remains very poor [4]. Recent advances in functional genomics provide an increasingly comprehensive portrayal of lung tumorigenesis, but the molecular pathogenesis of lung cancer remains poorly understood. These findings highlight the need for a better understanding of novel molecular mechanisms to guide treatment of lung cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that repress target gene expression by a combination of mRNA degradation and translation inhibition [5]. Recently, miR-21 expression was found to be higher in lung cancer serum samples than in control serum samples [3, 6–9]. High serum miR-21 was significantly correlated with tumor node metastases stage and lymph node metastasis of NSCLC patients [3, 5]. Overexpression of miR-21 showed a highly discriminative ROC curve profile, clearly distinguishing cancer patients from cancer-free subjects, and the detection of miR-21 expression yielded high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of lung cancer [7–9]. Furthermore, miR-21 expression was elevated in human lung cancer cell lines (NCI-H446 and NCI-H460) [2]. Human mutS homolog 2 (hMSH2), one of the core mismatch repair genes, is affected in lung cancer development. Zhong et al. [2] found that hMSH2 was directly regulated by miR-21, and miR-21 expression was inversely correlated with hMSH2 expression in human lung cancer cell lines [2]. Notably, upregulation of miR-21 markedly promoted cell proliferation and revealed a higher proportion of cells at S phase. However, knockdown of miR-21 expression led to cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and inhibited cell proliferation [2]. Similarly, tumor tissues showed an inverse correlation between high expression of miR-21 and low amounts of PTEN protein, where miR-21 suppresses PTEN by direct binding to the 30-UTR of PTEN [5]. Lung cancer cell lines (A549, H1703, and 801D) transfected with miR-21 inhibitor showed decreased endogenous miR-21 levels but significantly increased PTEN protein expression [5]. In addition, A549 and H1703 cells transfected with miR-21 inhibitor could restrain the growth of A549 and H1703 cells, and downregulation of miR-21 with miR-21 inhibitor in 801D cells could restrain its invasion ability [5]. Collectively, available evidence suggests that miR-21 may be a good biomarker for detection of lung cancer, and miR-21 may play an important role in lung cancer. However, further studies, especially in human systems, are needed to comprehensively explore the role of miR-21 in lung cancer, and miR-21 may be a potential therapeutic target for lung cancer. S.-C.

2,"Prevalence and causes of air pollution and lung cancer in Xuanwei City and Fuyuan County, Yunnan Province, China Xuanwei City and Fuyuan County of the Yunnan Province in south-west China are located in late Permian coal-accumulating areas. Both regions are rich in coal resources and have many coal mines. In the 1970s, epidemiologic studies demonstrated that lung cancer rates in Xuanwei were 4–5 times higher than the average in China [1,2]. The characteristics of these lung cancer incidences in the populations of Xuanwei and Fuyuan were described in previous studies. First, more women in Xuanwei and Fuyuan suffered from lung cancer, in comparison to other areas. The male-to-female ratio of lung cancer incidences in Xuanwei was 1.09∶1. However, almost all of these women did not smoke. In contrast, the male-to-female ratios of lung cancer incidences in China and the United States were 2.07∶1 and 1.8∶1, respectively [3]. Second, the major type of lung cancer in women in Xuanwei and Fuyuan was adenocarcinoma [4]. Third, the rural population suffered from lung cancer more than the urban population [3]. Previous studies demonstrated that indoor air pollution caused by burning “smoky coal” in non-vented indoor fire pits was the main reason for lung cancer in Xuanwei [5–7]. Burning “smoky coal” releases cancer-causing substances such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [8]. Animal experiments confirmed that the combustion products from burning “smoky coal” were more tumorigenic than those from wood and smokeless coal [9]. In the 1970s, the local government and the Science and Technology Department of the Yunnan Province encouraged and supported the residents of Xuanwei and Fuyuan to modify their fire pits into stoves with chimneys. In the late 1980s, the stove improvement project was completed, and the levels of indoor air pollution as well as lung cancer incidences subsequently decreased [10,11]. However, the indoor air pollution was not able to fully explain the current characteristics of lung cancer in Xuanwei and Fuyuan. The total morbidity and mortality rates from lung cancer did not decrease even after the region-wide household stove improvement. Both rates increased in some towns and villages after the first decade. From 2002 to 2005, the total mortality from lung cancer in Xuanwei was still very high, and the lung cancer rate was 3.3 times higher than elsewhere [12–15]. Therefore, the reason for the unabated high incidence of lung cancer in Xuanwei and Fuyuan must be determined. We hypothesize that despite the elimination of indoor air pollution, industrial developments heightened the outdoor air pollution level. Consequently, the lung cancer rate increased. This hypothesis is supported by the following observations. First, in Xuanwei, coal production and other coal-using industries (e.g., coal coking and thermal power generation) are very important. These industries very rapidly developed. Indeed, coal production, coal coking, and thermal power generation increased more than 5, 10, and 10 times, respectively, over the past 30 years. Within the same period, the mortality rate from lung cancer also increased 4 times (Fig. 1) [12–15]. This direct correlation has prompted us to"
2,"Five-year lung cancer mortality risk analysis and topography in Xuan Wei: a spatiotemporal correlation analysis. In Xuan Wei, China, the lung cancer mortality rate is rising significantly more than that of the nation overall. However, it remains unclear 1) if improved diagnosis can just partially explain this observation and how other local risk factors may be correlated with the lung cancer mortality rate and 2) how the lung cancer mortality rates differ within Xuan Wei and how these spatiotemporal patterns are linked with local risk factors. To increase etiological knowledge, this study evaluated the spatial and temporal distributions of the health effects (the lung cancer mortality rates) from 2011 to 2015. Four steps of spatial analysis were applied, as follows: 1) hotspot analysis to determine the geographical patterns of lung cancer mortality, 2) spatially-weighted sum to identify areas with higher health risks, 3) bivariate statistical analysis to assess the overall correlation between coal mines and lung cancer mortality, and 4) geographically-weighted regression to test for correlations among different towns within Xuan Wei. Women had higher lung cancer mortality rates than those in men, with an increasing trend in both sexes over time. The incidence rates in Laibin Town were the highest in Xuan Wei every year. Over the 5-year study period, the lung cancer mortality was increasingly concentrated in Laibin, Shuanglong, and Longchang, where the smoky coal mines are most concentrated. The population-level health risks from the coal mine in Xuan Wei were mapped and divided into five types of risk areas (Type I – Type IV). Correlation analysis revealed that there was no significant correlation between lung cancer mortality as a whole and coal mine distribution during the 5-year study period. However, the geographically-weighted regression revealed a stronger correlation in medium (Type III) and second-lowest (Type IV) health risks. Xuan Wei lung cancer mortality has increased continuously since the third national retrospective surveys on the causes of death by the Ministry of Health of the People’s Republic of China (2004–2005), especially for local women and residents over 35 years of age. Geographically, lung cancer in Xuan Wei showed unique spatiotemporal clustering. The local lung cancer mortality was significantly correlated with the smoky coal mine geographically. Some specific towns (Laibin, Shuanglong, and Longchang) within Xuan Wei manifested high correlations between lung cancer mortality and coal mines. The effects of coal mines on lung cancer mortality rates also spread geographically outward from these areas. Public health concern regarding lung cancer in Xuan Wei should prioritize higher-risk towns surrounded by smoking coal mines. Intervention strategies for particular toxic coal types require further studies on their chemical characteristics and mechanisms of carcinogenesis. Additional studies are also warranted to systematically examine the local environmental health risks related to coal industries and combustion air pollution and eventually to conduct early screening of lung cancer for local people who are more exposed to smoky coal in high-risk areas."

Marital status of unmarried persons, people with a history of lung-related disease, corporate personnel and production /service personnel were protective factors for lung cancer. People younger than 50 years old, people who were smoking and quit smoking, people who had been drinking consistently, people with family history of cancer and PM2.5 exposure were proven to be a risk factor for lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer varied with sex, smoking status and air pollution. Consistent alcohol consumption, persistent smoking and smoking quit were risk factors for lung cancer in men. By smoking status, male was risk factor for lung cancer in never smokers. Consistent alcohol consumption added risk for lung cancer in never smokers. The combined effects of PM2.5 pollution exposure and ever smoking aggravated the incidence of lung cancer. According to air pollution, lung cancer risk factors are completely different in lightly and heavily polluted areas. In lightly polluted areas, a history of lung-related disease was a risk factor for lung cancer. In heavily polluted areas, male, consistent alcohol consumption, a family history of cancer, ever smokers and smoking quit were all risk factors for lung cancer. A nomogram was plotted and the results showed that PM2.5 was the main factor affecting the occurrence of lung cancer.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">The large-scale accurate analysis of multiple risk factors in different air quality environments and various populations, provide clear directions and guidance for lung cancer prevention and precise treatment.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2023.

2,"Survival analysis of patients with primary breast duct carcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma: a population-based study from SEER. The appeal to enroll patients with primary breast and lung cancer in clinical trials is increasing, but survival of these two primary cancers remains to be elucidated. This study analyzed the prognosis of primary breast duct carcinoma with subsequent lung adenocarcinoma (BCLA) and primary breast duct carcinoma with prior lung adenocarcinoma (LABC). Cohorts of 3,515 patients with BCLA and 654 patients with LABC were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Patients were classified into simultaneous two primary cancer (sTPC), metachronous two primary cancer (mTPC1), or mTPC2 groups when the interval times between breast and lung cancer were within 6 months, between 7 and 60 months, or over 60 months, respectively. The propensity score matching program (PSM) was applied to determine the survival of BCLA/LABC relative to single breast/lung cancer. Cox proportional hazard regression model and competing risk modes were performed to identify confounders associated with all-cause and cancer-specific death, respectively. Survival of patients with LABC/BCLA relative to single breast/lung cancer was accessed via median survival time. The survival of patients with BCLA/LABC was generally poor compared with the survival of those with single breast cancer. The PSM-estimated HR in the sTPC group with BCLA and in the mTPC1 and mTPC2 groups with LABC were 0.75 (95% CI 0.62–0.90), 0.52 (95% CI 0.27–0.98), and 0.36 (95% CI 0.20–0.65), respectively, whereas the SHRs were 0.80 (95% CI 0.66–0.97), 0.68 (95% CI 0.34–1.34), and 0.46 (95% CI 0.27–0.80), respectively, compared with those in the single lung cancer group. By contrast, the survival rates of the remaining patients did not differ. The median survival times since secondary malignancy were 42, 23, and 20 months in the sTPC, mTPC1, and mTPC2 groups with BCLA, respectively, and 18, 60, and 180 months in those with LABC, respectively. For patients with BCLA, the adjusted Cox regression suggested incidences of all-cause deaths in mTPC1group were statically higher than those in sTPC group, whereas the incidences of all-cause and cancer-specific death in the mTPC1 and mTPC2 groups were statistically lower than those in the sTPC group. The prognosis of patients with breast cancer and subsequent lung cancer of over 18 months was not significantly different than that of single lung cancer, which supported the profound appeal to increase the involvement of these two primary cancers in potential beneficial clinical trials. For patients with lung cancer and prior breast cancer of within 6 months and subsequent breast cancer of over 18 months, prognosis was improved relative to single lung cancer. Therefore, additional attention is needed to eliminate the potential bias may when these patients are recruited in the clinical trials."

2,"Gene-expression data integration to squamous cell lung cancer subtypes reveals drug sensitivity Background: Squamous cell lung cancer (SqCC) is the second most common type of lung cancer in the United States. Previous studies have used gene-expression data to classify SqCC samples into four subtypes, including the primitive, classical, secretory and basal subtypes. These subtypes have different survival outcomes, although it is unknown whether these molecular subtypes predict response to therapy. Methods: Here, we analysed RNAseq data of 178 SqCC tumour samples and characterised the features of the different SqCC subtypes to define signature genes and pathway alterations specific to each subtype. Further, we compared the gene-expression features of each molecular subtype to specific time points in models of airway development. We also classified SqCC-derived cell lines and their reported therapeutic vulnerabilities. Results: We found that the primitive subtype may come from a later stage of differentiation, whereas the basal subtype may be from an early time. Most SqCC cell lines responded to one of five anticancer drugs (Panobinostat, 17-AAG, Irinotecan, Topotecan and Paclitaxel), whereas the basal-type cell line EBC-1 was sensitive to three other drugs (PF2341066, AZD6244 and PD-0325901). Conclusion: Compared with the other three subtypes of cell lines, the secretory-type cell lines were significantly less sensitive to the five most effective drugs, possibly because of their low proliferation activity. We provide a bioinformatics framework to explore drug repurposing for cancer subtypes based on the available genomic profiles of tumour samples, normal cell types, cancer cell lines and data of drug sensitivity in cell lines. Lung cancer now accounts for 13% of new cancer cases and 29% of all cancer deaths each year in the United States. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, leading to an estimated 1.4 million deaths in 2010. Lung cancer is a heterogeneous disease with multiple histological and molecular subtypes. Lung cancers are usually classified according to the histological types because the histopathological type of lung cancer correlates with tumour behaviour and prognosis (Beadsmoore and Screaton, 2003). The vast majority of lung cancer types are carcinoma malignancies that arise from epithelial cells. The two most common subtypes of lung cancer are adenocarcinoma and squamous cell lung cancer types (SqCC). Squamous cell lung cancer is the second most common type of lung cancer, usually originating in the large airways in the central part of the lungs. Even for patients with SqCCs, outcomes are variable, suggesting that heterogeneity exists within this subtype. Further classification of SqCC into subtypes may help to understand the disease mechanism better, define the pathways relevant in disease origin and pathogenesis, and help guide treatment."
2,"Polymorphisms of CYP1A1 I462V and GSTM1 genotypes and lung cancer susceptibility in Mongolian Aim: To study the genotype of cytochrome P450 1A1(CYP1A1) I462V and glutathions S-transferase M1( GSTM1) and the relationship of the genetic polymorphism of them with the susceptibility of lung cancer in Mongolia of China. Methods: Allele-specific PCR and a multiplex PCR were employed to identify the genotypes of I462V of CYP1A1 and GSTM1 in a case-control study of 210 lung cancer patients with bronchoscopy diagnosis and 210 matched controls free of malignancy. The frequencies of the variant CYP1A1(Val/Val) genotypes and GSTM1(-) in lung cancer groups were higher than that in control groups (15.24% vs 7.4% and 56.67% vs 40.95% ). The individuals who carried with CYP1A1(Val/Val) or GSTM1(-) genotype had a significantly higher risk of lung cancer, the OR is 2.56 and 1.89 respectively. Stratified histologically the relative risk increased to 2.6 - fold when the patients carried with two valine alleles than the ones carried one valine allele in cases of SCC. GSTM1(-) genotype is the risk factor of SCC (OR=2.39) and AC(OR=2.16). The presence of at least one Val allele of CYP1A1 and GSTM1(-), the risk of lung cancer was increased, the OR was 4.15 for one Val allele and GSTM1(-) and 2.67 for two Val alleles and GSTM1 Considering ages and smoking status, the risk of lung cancer increased when the age less than 50 who carried with CYP1A1 valine (one or two) alleles or the age during the 51 to 65 who carried with GSTM1(-) genotype. The light smokers with CYP1A1 valine alleles and GSTM1(-) have a high risk for lung cancer. No association was found between the light and heavy drinkers with the susceptibility of lung cancer and the genetic polymorphisms of CYP1A1 I462V and GSTM1(-). Conclusion: The valine allele of CYP1A1 was the risk factors of lung cancer especially for SCC and GSTM1(-) also was the risk factor of lung cancer and especially for SCC and AC of Mongolian, China. Light smoking has a influence each other with genotype of CYP1A1 I462V and GSTM1(-) and susceptibility of lung cancer. No relationship was found between the susceptibility of lung cancer and drinkers with genetic polymorphisms of CYP1A1 I462V and GSTM1(-). The influence of genotypes on the susceptibility of lung cancer may depend on the ages. There may be a synergetic interaction between CYP1A1 valine allele and GSTM1(-) genotypes on the elevated susceptibility of lung cancer. So do those genotypes with light smokers.

2,"Estradiol-mediated inhibition of Sp1 decreases miR-3194-5p expression to enhance CD44 expression during lung cancer progression. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Sp1, an important transcription factor, is involved in the progression of various cancers. Our previous studies have indicated that Sp1 levels are increased in the early stage of lung cancer progression but decrease during the late stage, leading to poor prognosis.

Tumor formation was more substantial in female EGFR<sup>L858R</sup> mice than in male mice and ovariectomized female mice, indicating that E2 might be involved in the poor prognosis of lung cancer. We herein report that Sp1 negatively regulates metastasis and cancer stemness in E2-A549 and A549-T24 cells. Furthermore, E2 increases the mRNA and protein levels of RING finger protein 4 (RNF4), which is the E3-ligase of Sp1, and thereby decreases Sp1 levels by promoting Sp1 degradation. Sp1 can be recruited to the promoter of miR-3194-5p, and positively regulate its expression. Furthermore, there was a strong inverse correlation between Sp1 and CD44 levels in clinical lung cancer specimens. Sp1 inhibited CD44 expression by increasing the expression of miR-3194-5p, miR-218-5p, miR-193-5p, miR-182-5p and miR-135-5p, ultimately resulting in lung cancer malignancy.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Premenopausal women with lung cancer and decreased Sp1 levels have a poor prognosis.

2,"SII and lung cancer in middle-aged and elderly population: the nonlinear connection and the mediating role of ABSI. Background Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality globally. Early identification of high-risk populations is crucial for improving prognosis. The Systemic Inflammatory Index (SII), as an indicator that comprehensively reflects the body’s inflammatory status, has unclear potential mediating factors associated with lung cancer risk and differences among different age groups. This study aims to explore the relationship between SII and lung cancer risk and analyze the differences among different age groups. Method This study included 37,780 individuals (NHANES data). By comparing their demographic and health-related characteristics, the relationship between SII and lung cancer risk was analyzed. A weighted generalized linear model was used to analyze the relationship between SII and lung cancer risk, adjusting for confounding factors such as gender, race, age, smoking history, alcohol drinking history, and the poverty-income ratio (PIR). Subgroup analyses were further conducted to explore the differences in the relationship between SII and lung cancer risk among individuals above and below the age of 50. In addition, the non-linear relationship between SII and lung cancer risk was explored through restricted cubic spline plots and threshold effect analysis, and the mediating effect of the Abdominal Body Shape Index (ABSI) was analyzed. Result The study found significant differences in age, SII, and ABSI between the two groups. Even after adjusting for confounding factors, SII was positively correlated with lung cancer risk (OR = 1.0006, P = 0.004). Subgroup analysis showed a more significant association between SII and lung cancer risk in individuals over the age of 50 (OR = 1.0004, P = 0.006). Restricted cubic spline plots and threshold effect analysis revealed a non-linear relationship between SII and lung cancer risk, with a significant inflection point at an SII value of 1113.6364. Additionally, ABSI had a stronger mediating effect on the relationship between SII and lung cancer in individuals over the age of 50 (mediating effect: 14.13%), while no mediating effect was observed in individuals under the age of 50. Conclusion This study indicates that SII is positively correlated with lung cancer risk, with a more pronounced association in individuals over the age of 50. The mediating effect of ABSI on the relationship between SII and lung cancer is stronger in individuals over 50 years old, while no mediating effect is observed in those under 50. The non-linear relationship between SII and lung cancer risk suggests that in clinical practice, the level of SII and its changing trend should be considered comprehensively.

2,"Genomic analyses based on pulmonary adenocarcinoma in situ reveal early lung cancer signature Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents more than about 80% of the lung cancer. The early stages of NSCLC can be treated with complete resection with a good prognosis. However, most cases are detected at late stage of the disease. The average survival rate of the patients with invasive lung cancer is only about 4%. Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) is an intermediate subtype of lung adenocarcinoma that exhibits early stage growth patterns but can develop into invasion. In this study, we used RNA-seq data from normal, AIS, and invasive lung cancer tissues to identify a gene module that represents the distinguishing characteristics of AIS as AIS-specific genes. Two differential expression analysis algorithms were employed to identify the AIS-specific genes. Then, the subset of the best performed AIS-specific genes for the early lung cancer prediction were selected by random forest. Finally, the performances of the early lung cancer prediction were assessed using random forest, support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) on four independent early lung cancer datasets including one tumor-educated blood platelets (TEPs) dataset. Based on the differential expression analysis, 107 AIS-specific genes that consisted of 93 protein-coding genes and 14 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified. The significant functions associated with these genes include angiogenesis and ECM-receptor interaction, which are highly related to cancer development and contribute to the smoking-free lung cancers. Moreover, 12 of the AIS-specific lncRNAs are involved in lung cancer progression by potentially regulating the ECM-receptor interaction pathway. The feature selection by random forest identified 20 of the AIS-specific genes as early stage lung cancer signatures using the dataset obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung adenocarcinoma samples. Of the 20 signatures, two were lncRNAs, BLACAT1 and CTD-2527I21.15 which have been reported to be associated with bladder cancer, colorectal cancer and breast cancer. In blind classification for three independent tissue sample datasets, these signature genes consistently yielded about 98% accuracy for distinguishing early stage lung cancer from normal cases. However, the prediction accuracy for the blood platelets samples was only 64.35% (sensitivity 78.1%, specificity 50.59%, and AUROC 0.747). The comparison of AIS with normal and invasive tumor revealed diseases-specific genes and offered new insights into the mechanism underlying AIS progression into an invasive tumor. These genes can also serve as the signatures for early diagnosis of lung cancer with high accuracy. The expression profile of gene signatures identified from tissue cancer samples yielded remarkable early cancer prediction for tissues samples, however, relatively lower accuracy for boold platelets samples."

2,"Molecular profiling of mouse lung tumors: association with tumor progression, lung development, and human lung adenocarcinomas. We have performed oligonucleotide array analysis on various murine lung tissues [normal lungs, lung adenomas, and lung adenocarcinomas (ACs)] using Affymetrix U74Av2 GeneChips to examine the complex genetic changes occurring during lung carcinogenesis. Analysis yielded 20 novel genes differentially expressed in both lung adenomas and ACs versus normal lungs, including the tumor suppressor APC2 and the oncogene Ros 1. In addition, 50 genes were found to be differentially expressed in lung adenomas versus lung ACs, including the differentiation factor Hox C6, the oncogene Ets 2, and the Ras nuclear transport factor, nuclear transport factor 2. To understand the potential relationship between genes expressed in murine lung tumors and its relationship to altered gene expression observed during embryogenesis and postnatal development, tissues from embryonic lungs and from lungs of mice up to 4 weeks following birth were examined using Affymetrix U74Av2 GeneChips. From this analysis, approximately 1300 genes were determined to exhibit differential expression in fetal lung versus postnatal lung. When we compared lung adenomas, lung ACs, and normal lung parenchyma, 24 developmentally regulated genes were found aberrantly expressed in lung tumors; these included the cell cycle control factor CDC5, the cellular differentiation factor TEA domain 4, and the proapoptotic factor BNIP 2. Finally, we compared the murine lung tumor gene expression data to the expression of genes in human lung cancer, in order to assess the relevance of murine lung cancer models in the study of human AC formation. When the 17 human lung ACs and six human lung large cell carcinomas were examined, it was found that 13 of the 17 human lung ACs clustered tightly together in a pattern that was different from the remaining four human lung ACs and six large cell carcinomas, which exhibited a different pattern. Interestingly, the mouse lung adenomas appeared similar to 13 clustered ACs, while mouse lung ACs appeared more similar in pattern to the group consisting of four ACs and six large-cell carcinomas (LCCs). Nevertheless, when compared with the combined human ACs, 39 genes with similar expression changes in murine lung tumors and human ACs/LCCs were identified, such as the oncogene-related BCL7B, the cell cycle regulator CDK4, and the proapoptotic Endophilin B1. Overall, we have determined, for the first time, the expression profiles during murine lung tumor progression and have established, at the molecular level, an association between murine lung tumorigenesis and lung development. We have also attempted to compare the expression profiles found in mouse lung cancers and those in human lung ACs."
2,"Progress in lung cancer: non-oat cell (non-small cell lung cancer). Lung cancer remains the greatest killing cancer in the United States with 149,000 new cases expected in 1987. The present expected mortality rate is 87 per cent. More women in the United States died of lung cancer than breast cancer in 1986. Asymptomatic, early and curable lung cancer in high risk individuals is usually found by routine chest X-ray. So-called Stage I lung cancer was reported to have a 83 per cent survival rate at three years by Martini and Beattie in 1977 and 70 per cent five year survival rate subsequently. When the more than 30,000 volunteer males were enrolled in the National Cancer Institute, national lung program for screening, 223 unsuspected lung cancers were found. 47 per cent were Stage I with a survival rate at five years of over 76 per cent. The PMI-Strang/Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center study found 53 cancers in its first screen and 235 lung cancers over the next eight years of the study. Forty per cent were Stage I with a five year survival rate of 70 per cent. Sputum cytology as compared to chest X-ray was of little additional value. Studies (Martini) of N1 lung cancer was found to have a 49 per cent survival rate following resection. The N2 group of lung cancers where the mediastinal tumor was surgically removable and followed by external radiation therapy had a 27 per cent survival rate at five years. Those tumors with solitary brain metastases where the solitary brain metastasis could be resected and the primary tumor controlled, gave a 27 per cent survival rate at six years. The group of advanced N2 disease where the mediastinum could not be completely cleared were a serious group of cancers. A study of 100 patients treated from 1977 to 1980 with surgery plus internal radiotherapy followed by external radiotherapy had an overall 22 per cent survival rate for four to eight years with most of the deaths occurring because of metastases outside the chest. More recently chemotherapy has been used pre-operatively for those individuals with advanced lung cancer in the chest then followed by a combination of surgery, internal radiotherapy, external radiotherapy and more chemotherapy, if chemotherapy sensitive. This is the so-called multidisciplinary approach. In our present early studies it seems that those so treated who are chemotherapy sensitive have a 44 per cent, two year survival rate in a group of patients considered to have extremely poor prognosis."

These circRNAs function through a sponge mechanism, interacting with microRNAs (miRNAs) to modulate mRNA expression levels. Nevertheless, the precise role of the circRNA-miRNA-mRNA regulatory network in immune regulation within lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains inadequately understood.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND MATERIALS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We utilized microarray datasets from the GEO NCBI database (GSE101586) to identify differentially expressed circRNAs (DEcircRNAs) in LUAD. CircBank was employed to predict the target miRNAs of DEcircRNAs, which were subsequently intersected with miRNAs from the GSE36681 database. The identified miRNAs were then predicted to target mRNAs using miRDB and miWalk, and intersections with immune-related genes from the IMMPORT database were analyzed. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed using Cytoscape software. The DAVID functional annotation tool was utilized to explore potential biological processes, molecular functions, and KEGG pathways associated with LUAD.

2,"An overview of mortality & predictors of small-cell and non-small cell lung cancer among Saudi patients. Lung cancer ranks as the top cancer worldwide in terms of incidence and constitutes a major health problem. About 90% of lung cancer cases are diagnosed at advance stage where treatment is not available. Despite evidence that lung cancer screening improves survival, guidelines for lung cancer screening are still a subject for debate. In Saudi Arabia, only 14% of lung cancers are diagnosed at early stage and researches on survival and its predictors are lacking. This overview analysis was conducted on predictors of lung cancer mortality according to the two major cancer types, small-cell lung cancers (SCLCs) and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) in Saudi Arabia. A secondary data analysis was performed on small-cell lung cancers (SCLCs) and Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) registered in the Saudi Cancer Registry (SCR) for the period 2009-2013 to estimate predictors of mortality for both lung cancer types. A total of 404 cases (197 SCLC and 207 NSCLC) were included in the analysis, all Saudi nationals. A total of 213 (52.75%) deaths occurred among lung cancer patients, 108 (54.82%) among SCLCs and 105 (50.72%) among NCSLCs. Three quarter of patients are diagnosis with advance stage for both SCLC & NSCLC. Univariate analysis revealed higher mean age at diagnosis in dead patients compared to alive patients for SCLCs (p=0.04); but not NSCLCs, a lower mortality for NSCLCs diagnosed in 2013 (p=0.025) and a significant difference in stage of tumor (p=0.006) and (p=0.035) for both SCLC and NSCLC respectively. In multiple logistic regression, stage of tumor was a strong predictor of mortality, where distant metastasis increased morality by 6-fold (OR=5.87, 95% CI: 2.01 - 17.19) in SCLC and by 3-fold (OR=3.29, 95% CI: 1.22 - 8.85) in NSCLC, compared to localized tumors. Those with NSCLC who were diagnosed in 2013 were less likely to die by 64% compared to NSCLC diagnosed in 2009 (OR=0.36, 95% CI: 0.14 - 0.93). Age, sex, topography and laterality were not associated with mortality for both types of lung cancer. We observed that the stage of the tumor is the strongest predictor of mortality for both SCLCs and NSCLs. This confirms the impact of diagnostic stage on survival. However, establishing Saudi-specific lung cancer screening guidelines will require further research on the benefits and harms of screening modalities in the Saudi population."
2,"The relationship between physical activity, obesity, and lung cancer risk by smoking status in a large prospective cohort of US adults. Physical activity has been associated with lower lung cancer risk in numerous studies with estimates ranging from 20 to 50% lower risk in the most versus the least active study participants. Underweight and obesity have also been associated with lower lung cancer risk, with a nonlinear, inverted U-shaped relationship. However, associations of physical activity and obesity with lung cancer are likely significantly confounded by smoking since individuals who smoke are generally less active and leaner than non-smokers, but few studies have examined these associations stratified by smoking status. Using data from 162,679 men and women who were cancer-free at enrollment (1992–1993) in the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition Cohort, we examined associations of baseline recreational physical activity (MET-hours per week; none, 0.1 to <8.75 (reference), 8.75–17.4, 17.5+ MET-hours/week), baseline body mass index (BMI, weight (kg)/height (m2); <18.5, 18.5–22.0 (reference), 22.1–24.9, 25.0–29.9, 30.0+ kg/m2), and waist circumference (measured in 1997; sex-specific quartiles) in relation to lung cancer risk stratified by smoking status and years since quitting among former smokers (never, current, former <10 years, former, 10–19 years, former 20+ years). Cox proportional hazards modeling computed hazard rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) while adjusting for potential confounders. During 2,384,546 person years of follow-up time, 4,669 men and women were diagnosed with lung cancer (453 among never smokers; 1,452 among current smokers; 1,194 among former smokers <10 years since quitting; 725 among former 10–19 years; and 845 among former 20+ years). Physical activity was not associated with lung cancer risk within any of the smoking strata except in former smokers less than 10 years since quitting (RR = 0.77; 95% CI 0.67–0.90 for 17.5+ MET-hours/week). Similarly, BMI was inversely associated with lung cancer in former smokers less than 10 years since quitting (RR = 0.68; 95% CI 0.55–0.84 for 30+ kg/m2) and more modestly in former smokers who quit 10–19 and 20+ years ago. Waist circumference was not associated with lung cancer risk in any smoking category. While being physically active and maintaining a healthy body weight are important for prevention of various chronic diseases, including several types of cancer, our results suggest that physical activity, BMI, and waist circumference are not associated with lung cancer risk, regardless of smoking status."
2,"Diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to lung cancer in Canada and their costs Escalating health care costs have made it imperative to evaluate the resources required to diagnose and treat major illnesses in Canadians. For Canadian men, lung cancer is not only the most common malignancy, but also the major cancer killer. As of 1994, lung cancer is expected to overtake breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer deaths in women. This paper presents a detailed description of the methodology used to determine the direct health care costs associated with 'standard' diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for lung cancer in Canada in 1988. Clinical algorithms were developed for each stage of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). The algorithms were designed to take the form of decision trees for each clinical stage of lung cancer. The proportion of patients assigned to each branch was based upon questionnaire responses obtained from thoracic surgeons and radiation oncologists when presented with clinical scenarios, and information from provincial cancer registries. Direct care costs were derived primarily from one provincial fee schedule (Ontario), and costing information obtained during the conduct of several Canadian clinical trials in lung cancer. Direct costs for diagnosis and initial treatment of NSCLC (excluding relapse and terminal care costs) ranged from $17,889 for the surgery/post-operative radiotherapy arm of stages I and II to $6,333 for the supportive care arm (stage IV). The cost of determining relapse for NSCLC was estimated to be $1,528, and terminal care costs, which included palliative radiotherapy and hospitalisation, were $10,331. Direct costs for diagnosis and initial treatment of SCLC ranged from $18,691 for limited stage disease to $4,739 for the supportive care arm of extensive disease. The cost of diagnosing relapse for SCLC was estimated to be $1,590, and terminal care costs averaged $9,966. This report provides an estimate of the Canadian costs of managing lung cancer by stage and treatment modality. Because the actual costs of all components of care are not available from any combination of sources, these cost estimates must be viewed as an idealised estimate of the cost of lung cancer management. However, we believe that the lung cancer costing model that we have developed provides a level of sophistication which gives a reasonable estimate of the cost per case of treating NSCLC and SCLC."
2,"A phenome-wide Mendelian randomization analysis reveals the genetical associations of myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease with lung cancer. Lung cancer is a complex disease with varying subtypes. The genetic architectures and risk factors that are similar or distinct among these subtypes remain unclear. In this work, Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted by the International Lung Cancer Consortium and transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung were utilized to illustrate the genetic landscapes of different subtypes of lung cancer. GWAS of 942 phenotypes from UK Biobank and 902 phenotypes from FinnGen Biobank were analyzed to identify the genetic risk factors specific or common to each subtype of lung cancer through two sample Mendelian randomization inverse variance weighting method. Multivariable Mendelian randomization was employed to assess the true causals of lung cancer. We found that lung cancer, small cell lung carcinoma, squamous cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma shared similar, yet varied genetic architectures. Genetic risk loci at 15q25 were identified in all types of lung cancer. Yet, genetic risk loci at 5p15 were observed in squamous cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma, but not in small cell lung carcinoma. Out of 942 phenotypes from UK Biobank, smoking, time spent watching television, age first had sexual intercourse, alcohol usually taken with meal and age at first live birth were common risk factors for all types of lung cancer. Moreover, out of 902 traits in FinnGen Biobank, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was positively associated with small cell lung carcinoma, squamous cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma. Angina pectoris and myocardial infarction were negatively associated with lung cancer, squamous cell lung cancer and lung adenocarcinoma. And Alzheimer's disease was negatively associated with lung cancer, small cell lung carcinoma and squamous cell lung cancer. In further weighted median and weighted mode methods, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease also had genetical associations with lung cancer or its subtypes. Even, considering factors such as smoking, COPD, and other risk factors together, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease retained the genetical associations with lung cancer and its subtypes. Overall, in a phenome-wide Mendelian randomization analysis, our results have highlighted both similar and distinct risk factors among different subtypes of lung cancer. Additionally, our findings have provided genetic associations linking myocardial infarction, angina pectoris and Alzheimer's disease with lung cancer or its various subtypes."

Early detection of lung cancer helps improve treatment and survival. Numerous aberrant DNA methylations have been reported in early-stage lung cancer. Here, we sought to identify novel DNA methylation biomarkers that could potentially be used for noninvasive early diagnosis of lung cancers.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">This prospective-specimen collection and retrospective-blinded-evaluation trial enrolled a total of 317 participants (198 tissues and 119 plasmas) comprising healthy controls, patients with lung cancer and benign disease between January 2020 and December 2021. Tissue and plasma samples were subjected to targeted bisulfite sequencing with a lung cancer specific panel targeting 9,307 differential methylation regions (DMRs). DMRs associated with lung cancer were identified by comparing the methylation profiles of tissue samples from patients with lung cancer and benign disease. Markers were selected with minimum redundancy and maximum relevance algorithm. A prediction model for lung cancer diagnosis was built through logistic regression algorithm and validated independently in tissue samples. Furthermore, the performance of this developed model was evaluated in a set of plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">We identified 7 DMRs corresponding to 7 differentially methylated genes (DMGs) including HOXB4, HOXA7, HOXD8, ITGA4, ZNF808, PTGER4, and B3GNTL1 that were highly associated with lung cancer by comparing the methylation profiles of lung cancer and benign nodule tissue. Based on the 7-DMR biomarker panel, we developed a new diagnostic model in tissue samples, termed ""7-DMR model"", to distinguish lung cancers from benign diseases, achieving AUCs of 0.97 (95%CI: 0.93-1.00)/0.96 (0.92-1.00), sensitivities of 0.89 (0.82-0.95)/0.92 (0.86-0.98), specificities of 0.94 (0.89-0.99)/1.00 (1.00-1.00), and accuracies of 0.90 (0.84-0.96)/0.94 (0.89-0.99) in the discovery cohort (n = 96) and the independent validation cohort (n = 81), respectively.

2,"Combined effects of lung disease history, environmental exposures, and family history of lung cancer to susceptibility of lung cancer in Chinese non-smokers Although cigarette smoking is a major risk factor for lung cancer, the incidence rate of lung cancer among non-smokers is notable. The etiology and potential mechanism of non-smoker lung cancer are worthy of further research. This study was designed to explore the collective effects of environmental factors and the relationship between environmental exposure index (EEI) and lung cancer among non-smokers by evaluating the joint effects among lung disease history, environmental factors, and family history of lung cancer without smoking confounders. A total of 767 never-smoked lung cancer cases and 767 sex- and age-matched controls were selected from the department of Thoracic Surgery and Respiratory Medicine of three hospitals in Fujian, China. We used two methods to develop the EEI according to 12 statistically significant environmental risk factors. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) was applied to analyze the non-linear relationship between EEI and lung cancer in non-smokers. Combined effects, additive interaction, and multiplicative interaction were assessed among lung disease history, EEI, and family history of lung cancer to estimate susceptibility to develop lung cancer. Lung disease history, especially asthma, was significantly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer with an odds ratio (OR) for asthma history of 14.720 (95% CI: 1.877–115.449). Family history of lung cancer was related to susceptibility of lung cancer (OR = 3.347, 95% CI: 1.930–5.806). According to type of relatives and cancer, a parental or children’s history and a sibling’s history of lung cancer were significantly associated with an increased risk of lung cancer. The positive association between EEI and lung cancer was apparently stronger in those with lung disease history or family lung cancer history. Furthermore, there was a addictive interaction between EEI and lung disease history, and a possibly addictive interaction between EEI and family lung cancer history on development of lung cancer. There were combined effects among lung disease history, environmental exposures, and family history of lung cancer toward susceptibility to lung cancer in Chinese non-smokers. Non-smokers who had a family history of lung cancer were at higher risk of lung cancer than non-smokers who had lung disease history. Non-smokers with family cancer history may obtain benefits from removal of environmental exposures and active treatment of lung disease."

The inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to ensure the appropriate selection of studies that align with the primary aim of understanding the cultural and systemic barriers to lung cancer screening (LCS) within the Spanish-speaking population in the United States over the past two decades. Case reports and systematic reviews were excluded to facilitate a more comprehensive analysis rather than focusing on individual cases or summaries of existing literature. Additionally, studies involving patients with advanced lung cancer were excluded, as the focus of this narrative review is to recognize the barriers to early detection of the disease, rather than the management of advanced-stage lung cancer or its treatment. The inclusion criteria were as follows: Qualitative studies, cross-sectional studies, randomized trials. Studies performed in the United States. Studies done from 2005-2024. Studies that discuss barriers to and perceptions of lung cancer screening in underserved populations including patients who identified as Latino and who speak Spanish. Studies involving lung cancer patient also describing ways cultural barriers and beliefs affect the perception of cancer screening.

Our study revealed that the incidence of stage 0 lung cancer increased with increasing LDCT scan volume, particularly during the peak growth period from 2017 to 2020. Conversely, stage 4 lung cancer cases remained consistent across different time intervals. Furthermore, the increase in the lung cancer screening volume had a more pronounced effect on the increase in stage 0 lung cancer cases among females than it had among males. The estimated potential for overdiagnosis brought about by the screening process, compared to non-participating individuals, ranged from an odds ratio of 7.617 to one of 17.114. Both strict and lenient definitions of overdiagnosis (evaluating cases of stage 0 lung cancer and stages 0 to 1 lung cancer) were employed.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">These results provide population-level evidence of potential lung cancer overdiagnosis in the Taiwanese population due to the growing use of LDCT screening, particularly concerning the strict definition of stage 0 lung cancer.

2,"YangZheng XiaoJi exerts anti-tumour growth effects by antagonising the effects of HGF and its receptor, cMET, in human lung cancer cells. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) ; is a cytokine that has a profound effect on cancer cells by stimulating migration and invasion and acting as an angiogenic factor. In lung cancer, the factor also plays a pivotal role and is linked to a poor outcome in patients. In particular, HGF is known to work in combination with EGF on lung cancer cells. In the present study, we investigated the effect of a traditional Chinese medicine reported in cancer therapies, namely YangZheng XiaoJi (YZXJ) on lung cancer and on HGF mediated migration and invasion of lung cancer cells. Human lung cancer cells, SKMES1 and A549 were used in the study. An extract from the medicine was used. Cell migration was investigated using the EVOS and by ECIS. Cell–matrix adhesion and in vitro invasion were assessed. In vivo growth of lung cancer was tested using an in vivo xenograft tumour model and activation of the HGF receptor in lung tumours by an immunofluorescence method. Both lung cancer cells increased their migration in response to HGF and responded to YZXJ by reducing their speed of migration. YZXJ markedly reduced the migration and in vitro invasiveness induced by HGF. It worked synergistically with PHA665752 and SU11274, HGF receptor inhibitors on the lung cancer cells both on HGF receptor activation and on cell functions. A combination of HGF and EGF resulted in a greater increase in cell migration, which was similarly inhibited by YZXJ, and in combination with the HGF receptor and EGF receptor inhibitors. In vivo, YZXJ reduced the rate of tumour growth and potentiated the effects of PHA665752 on tumour growth. It was further revealed that YZXJ significantly reduced the degree of phosphorylation of the HGF receptor in lung tumours. YZXJ has a significant role in reducing the migration, invasion and in vivo tumour growth of lung cancer and acts to inhibit the migratory and invasive effects induced by HGF and indeed by HGF/EGF. This effect is likely attributed to the inhibition of the HGF receptor activation. These results indicate that YZXJ has a therapeutic role in lung cancer and that combined strategy with methods to block HGF and EGF should be considered."
2,"PPAR γ changing ALDH1A3 content to regulate lipid metabolism and inhibit lung cancer cell growth. PPAR γ, as a widely present receptor in tissues, plays a key role in lipid metabolism, energy balance, inflammatory response, and cell differentiation. It plays an important role in the occurrence and development of various tumors, including prostate cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer, etc., by regulating lipid metabolism. However, the specific mechanism by which it affects lung cancer growth is not yet clear. To investigate how PPAR γ affects lung cancer cell growth by altering ALDH1A3 levels through its impact on lipid metabolism. Bioinformatics analysis was used to predict the correlation between PPAR γ, ALDH1A3 and lung cancer. Based on the results of bioinformatics analysis, PPAR γ activator (Pioglitazone, Pio) and ALDH1A3 inhibitor (diethylaminobenzaldehyde, DEAB) were used to act on lung cancer cells and observe their growth. After measuring the IC50 value of the drug in vitro experiments, lipid metabolomics analysis was conducted to identify the significant changes in differential metabolites and metabolic pathways under the combined influence of Pio and DEAB. Through bioinformatics analysis, it was found that there were significant differences in the levels of PPAR γ and ALDH1A3 between lung cancer and normal lung tissues, and ALDH1A3 was positively correlated with PPAR γ. AUC analysis found that PPAR γ and ALDH1A3 have good predictive value in the diagnosis and prognosis of lung cancer. GSEA enrichment analysis showed that PPAR γ and ALDH1A3 were significantly correlated with lipid oxidation. Combining relevant literature to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of PPAR γ receptors on lung cancer cells and the ability of PPAR γ activation to inhibit ALDH1A3 levels. Further in vitro CCK-8 and IC50 measurements of lung cancer cells A549 and H1299 were conducted, followed by non targeted lipidomics analysis. It was found that the metabolic pathways upregulated by activation of PPAR γ and inhibition of ALDH1A3 included glycerophospholipid metabolism, cholesterol metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism, and fat digestion and absorption, with glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway accounting for the highest percentage. Conclusion: PPAR γ activation can inhibit the production of ALDH1A3, alter the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway, and thus inhibit the proliferation of lung cancer cells. This study confirms that PPAR γ affects lung cancer proliferation by influencing the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway."

2,"Analysis of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and Fas/FasL in Japanese patients with non-small cell lung cancer associated with HLA-A2. Abstract ; Purpose. In recent years, the use of immunotherapy for malignant tumors has been proposed. To explore the significance of immunotherapy for lung cancer, we examined two systems : the HLA class I and cancer-reactive CTL system, and the Fas-FasL system. ; Methods. HLA class I (HLA-A, -B, and -C) antigens were determined in 61 patients with lung cancer and in 30 healthy controls. The HLA class I phenotype was investigated by serological techniques. HLA-A2 alleles were investigated by polymerase chain reaction sequence-specific primer analysis. We analyzed lymphocytes isolated from 61 patients with two-color surface labeling and flow cytometry. Furthermore, we analyzed sFas and sFasL expression by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We also examined lung cancer cell line-induced apoptosis of CD8+ lymphocytes using confocal laser scanning microscopy. ; Results. The HLA-A2 allele was observed in 27 of 61 patients with lung cancer. There were no differences in HLA-A2 allele classifications between lung cancer patients and controls. Thirty-six of the 61 lung cancer patients (57%) had elevated levels of sFas, and 16 of the 61 patients (26.2%) had elevated levels of sFasL. The sFas level of lung cancers with HLA-A2 was significantly higher than that of cancers without HLA-A2 (P<0.01). This tendency was observed in every lung cancer tissue type, and the sFas levels of lung cancers with HLA-A2 associated significantly with the CTL levels of lung cancers with HLA-A2. Furthermore, compared to lung cancers without HLA-A2, CD8+ T-cell levels were elevated in lung cancers with HLA-A2. In contrast, sFas levels of non-small cell lung cancers without HLA-A2 were higher than those in lung cancers with HLA-A2. In an in vitro experiment using lung cancer cell lines, we observed apoptosis of CD8+ lymphocytes induced by lung cancer cells. Lung cancer-reactive CTLs are mobilized easily by restriction of HLA-A2, but this restriction is not always specific. In addition, FasL derived from lung cancer cells can induce apoptosis of CD8+ T-cells, and the frequency of this phenomenon is increased in small cell lung cancers without HLA-A2. ; Conclusion. Our findings suggest that the effect of immunotherapy may be insufficient for non-small cell lung cancer without HLA-A2."

2,"Identification of a panel of sensitive and specific DNA methylation markers for lung adenocarcinoma Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer of both men and women in the United States. Three quarters of lung cancer patients are diagnosed with regionally or distantly disseminated disease; their 5-year survival is only 15%. DNA hypermethylation at promoter CpG islands shows great promise as a cancer-specific marker that would complement visual lung cancer screening tools such as spiral CT, improving early detection. In lung cancer patients, such hypermethylation is detectable in a variety of samples ranging from tumor material to blood and sputum. To date the penetrance of DNA methylation at any single locus has been too low to provide great clinical sensitivity. We used the real-time PCR-based method MethyLight to examine DNA methylation quantitatively at twenty-eight loci in 51 primary human lung adenocarcinomas, 38 adjacent non-tumor lung samples, and 11 lung samples from non-lung cancer patients. We identified thirteen loci showing significant differential DNA methylation levels between tumor and non-tumor lung; eight of these show highly significant hypermethylation in adenocarcinoma: CDH13, CDKN2A EX2, CDX2, HOXA1, OPCML, RASSF1, SFPR1, and TWIST1 (p-value << 0.0001). Using the current tissue collection and 5-fold cross validation, the four most significant loci (CDKN2A EX2, CDX2, HOXA1 and OPCML) individually distinguish lung adenocarcinoma from non-cancer lung with a sensitivity of 67–86% and specificity of 74–82%. DNA methylation of these loci did not differ significantly based on gender, race, age or tumor stage, indicating their wide applicability as potential lung adenocarcinoma markers. We applied random forests to determine a good classifier based on a subset of our loci and determined that combined use of the same four top markers allows identification of lung cancer tissue from non-lung cancer tissue with 94% sensitivity and 90% specificity. The identification of eight CpG island loci showing highly significant hypermethylation in lung adenocarcinoma provides strong candidates for evaluation in patient remote media such as plasma and sputum. The four most highly ranked loci, CDKN2A EX2, CDX2, HOXA1 and OPCML, which show significant DNA methylation even in stage IA tumor samples, merit further investigation as some of the most promising lung adenocarcinoma markers identified to date."

2,"WNT pathway inhibition sensitizes HAT1-high lung cancers to treatment with PD-1 inhibitors. Background Immunotherapies change the paradigm of current pulmonary oncological clinics, although majority of patients fail to benefit from these treatment modalities. HAT1 overexpression is frequently diagnosed in lung cancer patients. Effective immunotherapeutic scheme remains to be determined for this portion of patients. Methods In vitro experiments were used to verify the transcriptional regulation of PD-L1 by HAT1 in lung cancer cells. Mouse syngeneic lung tumors with sgHAT1 were treated with PD-1 antibodies to determine the impact of deficiency of HAT1 on the sensitivity of lung cancers to PD-1 inhibitors. RNA-seq and Chip-seq analyses revealed the effect of HAT1 on the WNT pathway. The impact of HAT1 on WNT signaling on stemness of lung cancer cells and their ability to escape immune surveillance were evaluated through a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments. Clinical relevance of expression level of HAT1 on prognosis of lung cancer patients were assessed using data from multiple public datasets. Carcinogenicity of HAT1 was evaluated using a transgenic mouse model in vivo. Results Silencing HAT1 expression downregulated PD-L1 expression in murine and human lung cancer cells. Notably, HAT1-knockout sensitized lung cancers to PD-1 antibody treatment. We found that HAT1 enhanced the stemness of lung cancer cells through enhancing expression of WNT ligands by direct binding of their promoter regions. WNT pathway inhibitor, ICG001, sensitized lung tumors to treatment with PD-1 antibody. HAT1 overexpression was highly frequent among lung cancer patients and was found transforming in vitro and tumorigenic in vivo. Conclusion This study demonstrates that overexpression HAT1 plays a critical role in mediating immune evasion in lung cancer. Mechanistically, on one hand, HAT1 upregulate PD-L1 expression in lung cancer cells. On the other hand, HAT1 enhances stem-like properties of lung cancer cells by upregulating several WNT ligands. Consequently, combined inhibition of the WNT pathway and PD-1 signaling effectively shrinks HAT1-high lung cancers. These findings highlight the critical role of HAT1 overexpression in lung cancer development and shed light on potential precision medicine for this portion of lung cancer patients.

2,"The imbalance in the complement system and its possible physiological mechanisms in patients with lung cancer. The clinical and experimental evidences for complement-cancer relationships are solid, whereas an epidemiological study reporting the imbalance of complement system in patients is still lacking. Using publicly available databases, we jointly compared the levels of complement components in plasma and lung cancer tissues. With iTRAQ proteomics, quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting, we analysed the differences in complement levels in lung cancer tissues and normal control tissues. Complement components are mainly synthesized by the liver and secreted into the blood. Using paired co-cultures of human normal QSG-7701 hepatocytes with lung cancer cells (A549, LTEP-α-2 or NCI-H1703) or human normal bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells, we examined the effects of lung cancer cells on complement synthesis and secretion in QSG-7701 hepatocytes. An integrated analysis of transcriptome and proteome datasets from 43 previous studies revealed lower mRNA and protein levels of 25 complement and complement-related components in lung cancer tissues than those in normal control tissues; conversely, higher levels of complement proteins were detected in plasma from patients than those in healthy subjects. Our iTRAQ proteome study identified decreased and increased levels of 31 and 2 complement and complement-related proteins, respectively, in lung cancer tissues, of which the reduced levels of 10 components were further confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. Paired co-cultures of QSG-7701 hepatocytes with A549, LTEP-α-2, NCI-H1703 or HBE cells indicated that lung cancer cells increased complement synthesis and secretion in QSG-7701 cells compared to HBE cells. The opposite associations between the levels of complement and complement-related components in lung cancer tissues and plasma from patients that have been repeatedly reported by independent publications may indicate the prevalence of an imbalance in the complement system of lung cancer patients. The possible mechanism of the imbalance may be associated not only with the decreased complement levels in lung cancer tissues but also the concurrent lung cancer tissue-induced increase in hepatocyte complement synthesis and plasma secretion in patients. And the imbalance should be accompanied by a suppression of complement-dependent immunity in lung cancer tissues coupled with a burden of complement immunity in the circulation of patients."
2,"Nicotine promotes the progression and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer by modulating the OTUB1-c-Myc-EZH2 axis. Smoking has been identified as a major risk factor for the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As a key component of tobacco smoke, nicotine is believed to play a significant role in promoting NSCLC growth and progression. EZH2 is an epigenetic regulator highly expressed in the tumor tissues of smokers. However, whether and how nicotine regulates the expression of EZH2 and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Bioinformatics analysis and immunohistochemistry were used to compare the expression of EZH2 in NSCLC samples between smokers and nonsmokers. Western blotting, real-time quantitative PCR, and immunofluorescence were employed to confirm the effects of nicotine on EZH2 expression. Cell Counting Kit-8 assays, colony formation assays, 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine staining, and Transwell assays were conducted to analyze the proliferation and metastasis of A549 and H1650 cells treated with siRNA or EZH2 inhibitors. Real-time quantitative PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays were performed to assess the regulatory effect of nicotine on EZH2 transcript levels via c-Myc. Coimmunoprecipitation and ubiquitination assays were used to assess the deubiquitination of c-Myc by OTUB1. Finally, a nude mouse model was used to evaluate the impact of combined c-Myc and EZH2 inhibitors on tumor proliferation and metastasis in vivo. EZH2 is expressed at relatively high levels in NSCLC patients, as determined by both bioinformatic and IHC analyses. Nicotine upregulates EZH2 expression and promotes the proliferation and metastatic ability of lung cancer cells. Inhibition of EZH2 with either DZNep or EPZ6438, EZH2 inhibitors, or siRNA significantly decreased the proliferative and metastatic capacity of NSCLC cells induced by nicotine treatment. Moreover, the study revealed that nicotine induces OTUB1 expression, stabilizes the c-Myc protein via deubiquitination, and enables c-Myc-mediated transcriptional activation of EZH2. Furthermore, the c-Myc inhibitor 10058-F4 exhibited synergistic effects with the EZH2 inhibitor DZNep in suppressing NSCLC cell proliferation and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo.Nicotine regulates the c-Myc/EZH2 signaling pathway via OTUB1-mediated deubiquitination, thereby promoting the proliferation and metastasis of NSCLC cells. This research reveals novel molecular mechanisms of nicotine in the development of NSCLC, providing a theoretical foundation for future therapeutic strategies."

2,"KLF8 overexpression promotes the growth of human lung cancer cells by promoting the expression of JMJD2A Non-small-cell lung cancer (lung cancer) has become one of the leading causes worldwide and the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. The transcriptional factor Kruppel like factor 8 (KLF8) is involved in the initiation, progression, transformation, and metastasis of diverse cancers. However, the roles of KLF8 in human non-small cell lung cancer remain unknown. CCK-8 kit and colony formation assay were performed to determine the cell growth of lung cancer cells. Flow cytometry analysis was used to evaluate apoptosis and cell cycle of lung cancer cells. Luciferase reporter assay was used to examine the activation of JMJD2A promoter by KLF8. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed to evaluate the binding of KLF8 to JMJD2A promoter. Western blot and polymerase chain reaction were applied to analyze the expression of interested genes. The mRNA and protein levels of KLF8 in human non-small cell lung cancer tissues were overexpressed compared with the non-cancer tissues. KLF8 was knocked down with lentivirus-mediated short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) in human lung cancer cells (A549 and H1299 cells). The phenotypic results showed that KLF8 knockdown decreased the proliferation rate and colony formation of lung cancer cells. By contrast, lentivirus-mediated KLF8 overexpression promoted the growth of lung cancer cells (A549 and H1299 cells) and non-cancerous bronchial epithelial cell line BEAS-2B. Next, we showed that KLF8 regulated cell cycle at the G0 phase but not regulates cellular apoptosis of lung cancer cells. KLF8 regulated the expression of the cell cycle regulators P21 and CDK4 in a JMJD2A-dependent manner and JMJD2A knockdown significantly blocked the functions of KLF8 in regulating cell cycle and proliferation of lung cancer cells. Finally, we observed that KLF8 bound the promoter of JMJD2A and facilitated the expression of JMJD2A. Our evidence demonstrated that KLF8 upregulation in human lung cancer promotes the cell proliferation and colony formation of lung cancer cells. KLF8 binds to the promoter of JMJD2A and subsequently regulates the expression of P21 and CDK4, which contributes to the regulation of cell cycle by KLF8. KLF8 may serve as a target for the treatment of human lung cancer."
2,"CLEC3B as a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in lung cancer and association with the immune microenvironment Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally. Discovering effective biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis is important to reduce the mortality rate and ensure efficient therapy for lung cancer patients. C-type lectin domain family 3 member B (CLEC3B) has been reported in various cancers, but its correlation with lung cancer remains elusive. The GEO, TCGA and Oncomine databases were analyzed to examine the expression of CLEC3B in lung cancer. The CLEC3B mRNA levels in 15 patient tissue samples were detected by real-time PCR and the CLEC3B protein levels in 34 patient tissue samples were detected by immunohistochemistry. A Chi-square test was performed to analyze the correlation of CLEC3B expression and clinicopathological factors. The diagnostic value of CLEC3B was revealed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models and Kaplan–Meier plots were used to evaluate the prognostic value of CLEC3B in lung cancer. The TIMER database was used to evaluate the correlation of CLEC3B and immune infiltration. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed tumor‐associated biological processes related to CLEC3B. CLEC3B is significantly downregulated in lung cancer patients compared with nontumor controls according to database analysis and patient tissue sample detection (p   0.9). Moreover, low expression of CLEC3B is related to poor progression-free survival (HR = 0.60, 95% CI 0.49–0.74, p = 8.3e−07) and overall survival (HR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.58–0.75, p = 2.1e−10), indicating it as a risk factor for lung cancer. Multivariate analysis value showed that low expression of CLEC3B may be an independent risk factor for disease‐free survival in lung cancer patients (HR = 0.655, 95% CI 0.430–0.996, Cox p = 0.048). In addition, we also investigated the potential role of CLEC3B in tumor-immune interactions and found that CLEC3B might be associated with the immune infiltration and immune activation of lung cancer, especially in squamous cell carcinoma. Our findings indicate that CLEC3B expression is downregulated in lung cancer and reveal the diagnostic and prognostic potential of CLEC3B in lung cancer and its potential as an immune-related therapeutic target in lung cancer."
2,"Expression of CLDN1 and CLDN10 in lung adenocarcinoma in situ and invasive lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma Non-mucinous bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) is considered the early stage of lung adenocarcinoma and is classified as the lung adenocarcioma in situ (AIS) by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society. This study was designed to investigate the gene expression differences between AIS (formerly non–mucinous BAC) and invasive lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma (LPA, formerly non-mucinous BAC pattern with >5 mm invasion, mixed type adenocarcinoma with BAC features) and to investigate the mechanism of the progression of lung adenocarcinoma in situ to invasive adenocarcinoma. Gene expression analysis was performed by using Agilent 4 × 44 K Whole Human Genome Oligo Microarray on 10 fresh frozen tissue samples of AIS and LPA, respectively. Real time RT-PCR was used to validate the differential expression of 13 genes selected by cDNA microarray on fresh frozen tissue samples from 41 patients with lung adenocarcinoma and 4 genes were confirmed. These 4 genes were then validated by western blotting. Immunohistochemical staining for these validated genes was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from 81 cases of lung adenocarcinomna. We identified a 13 gene expression signature by comparative analysis of gene expression. Expression of these genes strongly differed between AIS and LPA. Four genes (MMP-2, c-fos, claudin 1 (CLDN1) and claudin 10(CLDN10)) were correlated with the results of microarray and real time RT-PCR analyses for the gene-expression data in samples from 41 patients with lung adenocarcinoma. As confirmed by western blotting, the expression levels of MMP-2 and c-fos were higher in LPA than those in AIS; the expression levels of CLDN1 and CLDN10 in LPA were lower than those in AIS. Immunohistochemical staining for these genes in samples from 81 cases of lung adenocarcinoma demonstrated the expressions of CLDN1 and CLDN10 were correlated with overall survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma. CLDN1 and CLDN10 may play important roles in the development of AIS to LPA. Overexpression of CLDN1 and CLDN10 indicates a favorable prognosis for overall survival in some patients with lung adenocarcinoma. Expression of CLDN10 may be regulated by the c-fos pathway."

2,"Evidence for tankyrases as antineoplastic targets in lung cancer New pharmacologic targets are urgently needed to treat or prevent lung cancer, the most common cause of cancer death for men and women. This study identified one such target. This is the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which is deregulated in cancers, including those lacking adenomatous polyposis coli or β-catenin mutations. Two poly-ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP) enzymes regulate canonical Wnt activity: tankyrase (TNKS) 1 and TNKS2. These enzymes poly-ADP-ribosylate (PARsylate) and destabilize axin, a key component of the β-catenin phosphorylation complex. This study used comprehensive gene profiles to uncover deregulation of the Wnt pathway in murine transgenic and human lung cancers, relative to normal lung. Antineoplastic consequences of genetic and pharmacologic targeting of TNKS in murine and human lung cancer cell lines were explored, and validated in vivo in mice by implantation of murine transgenic lung cancer cells engineered with reduced TNKS expression relative to controls. Microarray analyses comparing Wnt pathway members in malignant versus normal tissues of a murine transgenic cyclin E lung cancer model revealed deregulation of Wnt pathway components, including TNKS1 and TNKS2. Real-time PCR assays independently confirmed these results in paired normal-malignant murine and human lung tissues. Individual treatments of a panel of human and murine lung cancer cell lines with the TNKS inhibitors XAV939 and IWR-1 dose-dependently repressed cell growth and increased cellular axin 1 and tankyrase levels. These inhibitors also repressed expression of a Wnt-responsive luciferase construct, implicating the Wnt pathway in conferring these antineoplastic effects. Individual or combined knockdown of TNKS1 and TNKS2 with siRNAs or shRNAs reduced lung cancer cell growth, stabilized axin, and repressed tumor formation in murine xenograft and syngeneic lung cancer models. Findings reported here uncovered deregulation of specific components of the Wnt pathway in both human and murine lung cancer models. Repressing TNKS activity through either genetic or pharmacological approaches antagonized canonical Wnt signaling, reduced murine and human lung cancer cell line growth, and decreased tumor formation in mouse models. Taken together, these findings implicate the use of TNKS inhibitors to target the Wnt pathway to combat lung cancer."
2,"EZH2 inhibitors reverse resistance to gefitinib in primary EGFR wild-type lung cancer cells. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer. In traditional anti-cancer therapy, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) have been proven to be beneficial for patients with EGFR mutations. However, patients with EGFR wild-type NSCLC were usually not respond to EGFR-TKIs. Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is a key molecular in the PRC2 complex and plays an important role in epigenetic regulation and is overexpressed in variant tumors. EZH2 inhibitors have been reported to sensitize variant tumor cells to anticancer drugs. This study aimed to investigate whether the EZH2 inhibitors, GSK343 and DZNep when combined with gefitinib can reverse EGFR-TKIs resistance in EGFR wild-type NSCLC cells. The RNA-sequencing data of patients with NSCLC [502 patients with lung squamous cell carcinoma, including 49 paracancerous lung tissues and 513 patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), including 59 paracancerous lung tissues] from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), were analyzed for EZH2 expression. EZH2 expression was verified in 40 NSCLC tissue cancer samples and their corresponding paracancerous tissues from our institute (TJMUGH) via RT-PCR. A549 and H1299 cells treated with siRNA or EZH2 inhibitors were subjected to cell viability and apoptosis analyses as well to EGFR pathway proteins expression analyses via western blotting. EZH2 was upregulated in human NSCLC tissues and correlated with poor prognosis in patients with LUAD based on data from both TCGA and TJMUGH. Both GSK343 and DZNep sensitized EGFR wild-type LUAD cells (A549 and H1299) to gefitinib and suppressed cell viability and proliferation in vitro by downregulating the phosphorylation of EGFR and AKT and by inducing cell apoptosis. Co-administration of EZH2 inhibitors (GSK343 or DZNep) with gefitinib exerted a stronger inhibitory effect on tumor activity, cell proliferation and cell migration than single drug administration in vitro and in vivo. These data suggest that the combination of EZH2 inhibitors with EGFR-TKIs may be an effective method for treating NSCLC-patients with EGFR-wild type, who do not want to undergo traditional treatment with chemotherapy."
2,"Spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence in China Lung cancer is the most common cancer in China. Previous studies have indicated that lung cancer incidence exhibits remarkable spatial heterogeneity, and lung cancer is related to outdoor air pollution. However, the non-linear spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence in China remains unclear. In this study, the relationships between the lung cancer incidence of males and females from 207 counties in China in 2013 with annual concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O3 were analysed. GeoDetector q statistic was used for examining the non-linear spatial association between outdoor air pollution and incidence of lung cancer. An apparent spatial and population gender heterogeneity was found in the spatial association between outdoor air pollution and lung cancer incidence. Among the six selected pollutants, SO2 has the greatest influence on lung cancer (q = 0.154 in females) in north China. In the south, each selected pollutant has a significant impact on males or females, and the mean q value in the south is 0.181, which is bigger than that in the north (q = 0.154). In addition, the pollutants have evident non-linear interaction effects on lung cancer. In north China, the interaction between SO2 and PM2.5 is the dominant interaction, with q values of 0.207 in males and 0.334 in females. In the south, the dominant interactive factors are between SO2 and O3 in males and between SO2 and CO in females, with q values of 0.45, 0.232 respectively. Smoking is a substantial contributor to lung cancer among men, either in South or North China, with q value of 0.143 and 0.129 respectively, and the interaction between smoking and air pollutants increases this risk. This study implies that the influence of SO2 and PM2.5 on lung cancer should be focused on in north China, and in the south, the impact of O3 and CO as well as their interaction with SO2 need to be paid more attention. Smoking, particularly in men, remains a significant risk factor for lung cancer in both North and South China."
2,"Serum C-reactive protein and risk of lung cancer: a case–control study Recent advances in lung cancer biology presuppose their inflammatory origin. Thus, CRP is regarded to play a key role in the development of lung cancer. Nevertheless, this interesting hypothesis and the role of inflammation in tumor biology remain complex and incompletely sure. Meanwhile, the association between CRP and risk of lung cancer was not stable in many published results. This study was conducted to evaluate the association between serum CRP and SNPs in the aspect of lung cancer risks, in order to assess its possible diagnostic and prognostic importance. We conducted a case-control study of 96 patients newly diagnosed of lung cancer and 124 controls in this research. Controls were individuals matched to lung cancer cases on age, gender and tobacco use. In order to increase the statistical power, never smokers were matched to patients by using a 3:1 ratio, whereas former and current smokers were matched equal to the patients. CRP concentrations were measured using a chemiluminescent immunoassay, and SNPs were assessed at five loci within the CRP gene (rs1417938, rs1800947, rs1205, rs2808630 and rs3093077) as part of a Golden Gate assay. Logistic regression was used to calculate OR and 95 % CI for lung cancer. CRP concentrations tended to be in positive association with lung cancer risk in our research (Q4 vs Q1: OR = 2.11, 95 % CI, 1.66-2.91, p trend < 0.01). Although CRP SNPs were related to CRP levels, they were not associated with lung cancer risk. In combined analyses, we observed a significant interaction (p (interaction) = 0.02) that positive associations were suggestive in younger (Q4 vs Q1: OR = 1.65, 95 % CI, 1.02-2.67, p trend = 0.18) and older individuals (Q4 vs Q1: OR = 2.66, 95 % CI, 1.45-3.98 p trend = 0.42). The risks of lung cancer were higher with elevated CRP levels among former smokers and current smokers. High levels of CRP were associated with increasing lung cancer risk, suggesting that CRP could be used as surrogate biomarker of angiogenesis and prognosis in lung cancer."
2,"Comparison between immunotherapy efficacy in early non-small cell lung cancer and advanced non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Currently, immunotherapy is widely used in the treatment of various stages of non-small cell lung cancer. According to clinical experience and results of previous studies, immunotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy seems to exhibit better efficacy against early resectable non-small cell lung cancer as compared to advanced lung cancer, which is often defined as unresectable non-small cell lung cancer. However, this observation has not been established in clinical studies. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the efficacy of immunotherapy in early and late lung cancer, wherein objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were used as evaluation indexes. The present study also evaluated the safety of immunotherapy in early and late lung cancer, wherein the rate of treatment-related adverse reactions (TRAEs) was used as an indicator.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Electronica databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other databases, were searched to identify relevant studies. Besides this, all the available reviews, abstracts, and meeting reports from the main international lung cancer meetings were searched manually. ORR, DCR, and TRAEs were extracted as the primary outcomes.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 52 randomized controlled trials involving 13,660 patients were shortlisted. It was observed that immunotherapy alone significantly improved DCR in early lung cancer in comparison to advanced lung cancer. Importantly, the improvement in ORR was not to the same extent as reported in the case of advanced lung cancer. The combination of immunotherapy with other therapies, especially immunochemotherapy, significantly improved ORR and DCR in early lung cancer. In terms of safety, immunotherapy either alone or in combination with other therapies exhibited a better safety profile in early lung cancer than in advanced lung cancer.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Altogether, the benefits of immunotherapy in early lung cancer appeared to be better than those observed in advanced lung cancer, especially with the regard to the regimen of immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy. In terms of safety, both immunotherapy alone and its combination with chemotherapy were found to be safer in early lung cancer as compared to advanced lung cancer.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2022.

2,"Long-term exposure to hypoxia inhibits tumor progression of lung cancer in rats and mice Hypoxia has been identified as a major negative factor for tumor progression in clinical observations and in animal studies. However, the precise role of hypoxia in tumor progression has not been fully explained. In this study, we extensively investigated the effect of long-term exposure to hypoxia on tumor progression in vivo.;  Rats bearing transplanted tumors consisting of A549 human lung cancer cells (lung cancer tumor) were exposed to hypoxia for different durations and different levels of oxygen. The tumor growth and metastasis were evaluated. We also treated A549 lung cancer cells (A549 cells) with chronic hypoxia and then implanted the hypoxia-pretreated cancer cells into mice. The effect of exposure to hypoxia on metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma in mice was also investigated. We found that long-term exposure to hypoxia a) significantly inhibited lung cancer tumor growth in xenograft and orthotopic models in rats, b) significantly reduced lymphatic metastasis of the lung cancer in rats and decreased lung metastasis of Lewis lung carcinoma in mice, c) reduced lung cancer cell proliferation and cell cycle progression in vitro, d) decreased growth of the tumors from hypoxia-pretreated A549 cells, e) decreased Na+-K+ ATPase α1 expression in hypoxic lung cancer tumors, and f) increased expression of hypoxia inducible factors (HIF1α and HIF2α) but decreased microvessel density in the lung cancer tumors. In contrast to lung cancer, the growth of tumor from HCT116 human colon cancer cells (colon cancer tumor) was a) significantly enhanced in the same hypoxia conditions, accompanied by b) no significant change in expression of Na+-K+ ATPase α1, c) increased HIF1α expression (no HIF2α was detected) and d) increased microvessel density in the tumor tissues. This study demonstrated that long-term exposure to hypoxia repressed tumor progression of the lung cancer from A549 cells and that decreased expression of Na+-K+ ATPase was involved in hypoxic inhibition of tumor progression. The results from this study provide new insights into the role of hypoxia in tumor progression and therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment."

The multiple nodules from the same patient was determined as major nodule and minor nodule. Additionally, the tumor tissues underwent histopathological evaluation through H&amp;E staining, complemented by a comprehensive series of immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses to detect protein expression. The detected protein markers encompassed PD-L1, Ki67, and others.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">For the 53 nodule samples from 26 MPLCs patients, EGFR was the mostly mutated genes, and the TP53 mutation frequency was notably different between major and minor nodules.

Additionally, both major and minor nodules demonstrated mostly similar immune microenvironment and PD-L1 protein expression, and a significantly higher expression of Ki67. A noteworthy suppression was observed in the immune microenvironment in nodules, revealed by the expression of macrophage, neutrophils, and NK cells. Furthermore, minor nodules exhibited a modestly elevated expression of macrophages compared to major nodules.

2,"Five-gene prognostic model based on autophagy-dependent cell death for predicting prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma. Non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the predominant form of lung cancer originating from lung epithelial cells, making it the most prevalent pathological type. Currently, reliable indicators for predicting treatment efficacy and disease prognosis are lacking. Despite extensive validation of autophagy-dependent cell death (ADCD) in solid tumor studies and its correlation with immunotherapy effectiveness and cancer prognosis, systematic research on ADCD-related genes in LUAD is limited. We utilized AddModuleScore, ssGSEA, and WGCNA to identify genes associated with ADCD across single-cell and bulk transcriptome datasets. The TCGA dataset, comprising 598 cases, was randomly divided into training and validation sets to develop an ADCD-related LUAD prediction model. Internal validation was performed using the TCGA validation set. For external validation, datasets GSE13213 (119 LUAD samples), GSE26939 (115 LUAD samples), GSE29016 (39 LUAD samples), and GSE30219 (86 LUAD samples) were employed. We evaluated the model's accuracy and effectiveness in predicting prognostic risk. Additionally, CIBERSORT, ESTIMATE, and ssGSEA techniques were used to explore immunological characteristics, drug response, and gene expression in LUAD. Real-time RT-PCR was conducted to assess variations in mRNA expression levels of the gene XCR1 between cancerous and normal tissues in 10 lung cancer patients. We identified 249 genes associated with autophagy-dependent cell death (ADCD) at both single-cell and bulk transcriptome levels. Univariate COX regression analysis revealed that 18 genes were significantly associated with overall survival (OS). Using LASSO-Cox analysis, we developed an ADCD signature based on five genes (BIRC3, TAP1, SLAMF1, XCR1, and HLA-DMB) and created the ADCD-related risk scoring system (ADCDRS). Validation of this model demonstrated its ability to predict disease prognosis and its correlation with clinical characteristics, immune cell infiltration, and the tumor microenvironment. To enhance clinical applicability, we integrated an ADCDRS nomogram. Furthermore, we identified potential drugs targeting specific risk subgroups. We successfully identified a model based on five ADCD genes to predict disease prognosis and treatment efficacy in LUAD, as well as to assess the tumor immune microenvironment. An efficient and practical ADCDRS nomogram was designed."
2,"Lung cancer screening in patients with previous malignancy: Is this cohort at increased risk for malignancy? To determine the rate of second primary lung cancer (SPLC) and describe the clinical characteristics and radiological findings in individuals with a prior history of cancer presenting to a low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lung cancer screening program at a tertiary cancer center. Patients with a previous history of malignancy, a life expectancy ≥ 5 years referred for CT lung cancer screening between May 2, 2011, and November 28, 2018, were included. Demographics regarding risk factors including smoking history and prior history of thoracic radiation were collected. CT scan features assessed nodule size, morphologic features, and number. The Lung-CT Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) scoring system was retrospectively applied to studies performed before October 2014 and prospectively applied to remainder of studies. Data was collected in a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)–compliant manner. A total of 543 patients were studied (mean age of 66 years). All had a previous history of cancer, most commonly breast cancer 205 (38%), head and neck cancer 105 (19%), and lung cancer 87 (16%). Of screening CTs performed, 17.5% were positive screening study results as per Lung-RADS scoring system. SPLC was diagnosed in 35 patients (6.4%) with 21 prevalence cancers detected and 14 interval cancers detected in subsequent screening rounds. The rate of screen-detected SPLC in patients with prior malignancy is higher than reported rates seen in historical prospective screening studies. Our study suggests the need for prospective research to evaluate any mortality benefit that screening may have in this population. • The rate of screen-detected second primary lung cancer in patients with prior malignancy is higher than reported rates seen in historical prospective randomized lung cancer screening studies in a general screened population.;  • Patients with a prior malignancy undergoing lung cancer screening have higher rates of positive screening studies and higher rates of invasive diagnostic procedures than those reported in a general screening population.;  • Prospective research is required to evaluate if screening offers a mortality benefit in this population."

2,"Potential genetic modifiers for somatic EGFR mutation in lung cancer: a meta-analysis and literature review Accumulating evidence indicates inherited risk in the aetiology of lung cancer, although smoking exposure is the major attributing factor. Family history is a simple substitute for inherited susceptibility. Previous studies have shown some possible yet conflicting links between family history of cancer and EGFR mutation in lung cancer. As EGFR-mutated lung cancer favours female, never-smoker, adenocarcinoma and Asians, it may be argued that there may be some underlying genetic modifiers responsible for the pathogenesis of EGFR mutation. We searched four databases for all original articles on family history of malignancy and EGFR mutation status in lung cancer published up to July 2018. We performed a meta-analysis by using a random-effects model and odds ratio estimates. Heterogeneity and sensitivity were also investigated. Then we conducted a second literature research to curate case reports of familial lung cancers who studied both germline cancer predisposing genes and their somatic EGFR mutation status; and explored the possible links between cancer predisposing genes and EGFR mutation. Eleven studies have been included in the meta-analysis. There is a significantly higher likelihood of EGFR mutation in lung cancer patients with family history of cancer than their counterparts without family history, preferentially in Asians (OR = 1.35[1.06–1.71], P = 0.01), those diagnosed with adenocarcinomas ((OR = 1.47[1.14–1.89], P = 0.003) and those with lung cancer-affected relatives (first and second-degree: OR = 1.53[1.18–1.99], P = 0.001; first-degree: OR = 1.76[1.36–2.28, P < 0.0001]). Familial lung cancers more likely have concurrent EGFR mutations along with mutations in their germline cancer predisposition genes including EGFR T790 M, BRCA2 and TP53. Certain mechanisms may contribute to the combination preferences between inherited mutations and somatic ones. Potential genetic modifiers may contribute to somatic EGFR mutation in lung cancer, although current data is limited. Further studies on this topic are needed, which may help to unveil lung carcinogenesis pathways. However, caution is warranted in data interpretation due to limited cases available for the current study."
2,"Reduction in arsenic intake from water has different impacts on lung cancer and bladder cancer in an arseniasis endemic area in Taiwan Excessive arsenic intake has a detrimental effect on human health, as reflected in an increase in cancer incidence. In an area on the southwest coast of Taiwan, arsenic intake from well water since the 1920s had caused an exceptionally high mortality from cancer. Municipal water has become available to people living in the arseniasis endemic area since the early 1970s. This study explored the impacts of reduction in arsenic intake from water on lung cancer and bladder cancer in the arseniasis endemic area in Taiwan. Chart records of 23,013 patients diagnosed with bladder cancer and 93,633 patients with lung cancer from 1979 to 2003 were retrieved from the Taiwan Cancer Registry Center. We used the age-period-cohort model to study the changes in the incidence of lung cancer and bladder cancer in the arseniasis endemic area and the rest of Taiwan. Three decades after municipal water supply to the arseniasis and black foot disease endemic area (BFDEA), we saw a marked decrease in the incidence of both bladder cancer and lung cancer in the area, especially for those in the later cohorts. The relative risk (RR) of getting a bladder cancer for people living in BFDEA when compared with those in the rest of Taiwan has dropped from 20 for the early cohorts to 5 for the late cohorts. As to lung cancer, the RR has decreased from 8 to between 1.5 and 2. Reduction in arsenic intake from water has a positive impact on the incidence of both lung and bladder cancer; however, while RR for lung cancer has dropped to below 2, RR for bladder cancer remained at around 5. The difference may be because (1) there are other risk factors beside the well-water intake or (2) bladder cancer may have longer latency period for excessive arsenic exposure than lung cancer. More studies are required to understand the causes behind the difference in RR for these two types of cancer."
2,"N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) gene polymorphisms in colon and lung cancer patients N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) metabolizes arylamines and hydrazines moeities found in many therapeutic drugs, chemicals and carcinogens. The gene encoding NAT2 is polymorphic, thus resulting in rapid or slow acetylator phenotypes. The acetylator status may, therefore, predispose drug-induced toxicities and cancer risks, such as bladder, colon and lung cancer. Indeed, some studies demonstrate a positive association between NAT2 rapid acetylator phenotype and colon cancer, but results are inconsistent. The role of NAT2 acetylation status in lung cancer is likewise unclear, in which both the rapid and slow acetylator genotypes have been associated with disease. We investigated three genetic variations, c.481C>T, c.590G>A (p.R197Q) and c.857G>A (p.G286E), of the NAT2 gene, which are known to result in a slow acetylator phenotype. Using validated PCR-RFLP assays, we genotyped 243 healthy unrelated Caucasian control subjects, 92 colon and 67 lung cancer patients for these genetic variations. As there is a recent meta-analysis of NAT2 studies on colon cancer (unlike in lung cancer), we have also undertaken a systematic review of NAT2 studies on lung cancer, and we incorporated our results in a meta-analysis consisting of 16 studies, 3,865 lung cancer patients and 6,077 control subjects. We did not obtain statistically significant differences in NAT2 allele and genotype frequencies in colon cancer patients and control group. Certain genotypes, however, such as [c.590AA+c.857GA] and [c.590GA+c.857GA] were absent among the colon cancer patients. Similarly, allele frequencies in lung cancer patients and controls did not differ significantly. Nevertheless, there was a significant increase of genotypes [c.590GA] and [c.481CT+c.590GA], but absence of homozygous c.590AA and [c.590AA+c.857GA] in the lung cancer group. Meta-analysis of 16 NAT2 studies on lung cancer did not evidence an overall association of the rapid or slow acetylator status to lung cancer. Similarly, the summary odds ratios obtained with stratified meta-analysis based on ethnicity, and smoking status were not significant. Our study failed to show an overall association of NAT2 genotypes to either colon or lung cancer risk."

2,"Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation after treatment for lung cancer. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in women and men in the United States. As of 1987, lung cancer deaths in women exceeded deaths caused by breast cancer. Despite years of research and improvements in surgical, chemotherapeutic, and radiation treatments, this fact remains unchanged. Equally dismal is that the expected 5-year survival rate for all patients with lung cancer is 15%. Although hidden in this number is improved survival for many patients who have early disease, it still translates into significant morbidity and early mortality for many patients. Although prevention is key, optimizing the care of these patients with lung cancer is also paramount. Cardiopulmonary rehabilitation programs have been shown to be effective in treating patients with chronic heart and lung diseases, among other illnesses, regardless of prerehabilitation functioning. Not only do morbidity and mortality from cancer hinge directly on premorbid functioning, health, and status, but functional status as a measure of baseline health is a reliable prognostic indicator for patients with lung cancer. As a result, including a program of exercise in any treatment regimen for cancer is sensible. However, rehabilitation in patients with lung cancer has not been studied well. Data on rehabilitation in patients with other cancers and illnesses (eg, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) are clear in the beneficial effects of supervised exercise on quality of life (QOL). To assess the role of cardiopulmonary rehabilitation in patients with lung cancer undergoing treatment, it is necessary to meld studies regarding patients with noncancerous conditions with studies addressing rehabilitation in patients with cancer. This fusion of information demonstrates that rehabilitation results in significant improvements in QOL in patients who participate, regardless of the disease in question. Although QOL may not always have been an obvious endpoint for treating patients with lung cancer, it is apparent from studies of the patients themselves that an improved QOL is far more important than other goals of therapy."
2,"Salivary-type amylase producing lung cancers examined clinically and pathologically in 260 Japanese patients of lung lobectomy or segmentectomy The causative mechanisms of lung cancers producing salivary-type amylase (S-Amy) were hypothesized from clinical and pathological analysis of lung cancers. A total of 260 Japanese patients who received lung lobectomy or segmentectomy during the last 4 years at Hamamatsu University Hospital, Japan, were objective patients in this study. Among the 260 patients, 212 patients were operated on for lung cancers. Of the 212 patients, 132 (62%) had adenocarcinoma and 38 (18%) had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), of which 32 adenocarcinoma, and 8 SCC patients had metastatic lung cancers. Twenty-five (78%) of the 32 adenocarcinoma patients showed metastatic cancers from colon cancers to the lungs, especially from rectal and sigmoid colon cancers. Twenty-one (21%) of 100 primary adenocarcinoma patients and 8 (27%) of 30 primary SCC patients had double cancers coexisting with the lung cancers during the last 7 years. Among the 29 patients of double cancers, 4 lung cancer patients showed coexisting gastric cancers. The mortality rate of 79 adenocarcinoma and 22 SCC patients with primary lung cancer but not double cancer was 14% during the 4 years of this study. In 12 (12%) patients of the 101 patients with primary lung cancers, bone metastases were confirmed by bone scintigraphy. All the nine (9%) patients with brain metastases were adenocarcinoma, which was confirmed by brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Serum amylase levels of the 79 adenocarcinoma and 22 SCC patients were 232 ± 343 (SD) and 156 ± 161 (SD) (IU/l), respectively, 1 day post-operation. Diabetes mellitus (DM) or borderline DM were found in 34 (43%) of the 79 adenocarcinoma and 16 (73%) of the 22 SCC patients. Of the 14 patients who died of lung cancers, 11 (79%) had DM. From these clinical and pathological findings, more than 70% of Japanese lung cancers were hypothesized to have developed from the oncogene of a retrovirus inserted into the 5' promoter of S-Amy genes (AMY1) in 60–70 age groups."

2,"Distinctive gene expression of human lung adenocarcinomas carrying LKB1 mutations LKB1, a tumor-suppressor gene that codifies for a serine/threonine kinase, is mutated in the germ-line of patients affected with the Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), which have an increased incidence of several cancers including gastrointestinal, pancreatic and lung carcinomas. Regarding tumors arising in non-PJS patients, we recently observed that at least one-third of lung adenocarcinomas (LADs) harbor somatic LKB1 gene mutations, supporting a role for LKB1 in the origin of some sporadic tumors. To characterize the pattern of LKB1 mutations in LADs further, we first screened for LKB1 gene alterations (gene mutations, promoter hypermethylation and homozygous deletions) in 19 LADs and, in agreement with our previous data, five of them (26%) were shown to harbor mutations, all of which gave rise to a truncated protein. Recent reports demonstrate that LKB1 is able to suppress cell growth, but little is known about the specific mechanism by which it functions. To further our understanding of LKB1 function, we analysed global expression in lung primary tumors using cDNA microarrays to identify LKB1-specific variations in gene expression. In all, 34 transcripts, 24 of which corresponded to known genes, differed significantly between tumors with and without LKB1 gene alterations. Among the most remarkable findings was deregulation of transcripts involved in signal transduction (e.g. FRAP1/mTOR, ARAF1 and ROCK2), cytoskeleton (e.g. MPP1), transcription factors (e.g. MEIS2, ATF5), metabolism of AMP (AMPD3 and APRT) and ubiquitinization (e.g. USP16 and UBE2L3). Real-time quantitative RT-PCR on 15 tumors confirmed the upregulation of the homeobox MEIS2 and of the AMP-metabolism AMPD3 transcripts in LKB1-mutant tumors. In addition, immunohistochemistry in 10 of the lung tumors showed the absence of phosphorylated FRAP1/mTOR protein in LKB1-mutant tumors, indicating that LKB1 mutations do not lead to FRAP1/mTOR protein kinase activation. In conclusion, our results reveal that several important factors contribute to LKB1-mediated carcinogenesis in LADs, confirming previous observations and identifying new putative pathways that should help to elucidate the biological role of LKB1."
2,"Extracellular vesicle-associated microRNA-221-3p secreted by drug-resistant lung cancer cells targets HMBOX1 to promote the progression of lung cancer. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have received increasing attention for their role as possible regulators of cancer. miR-221-3p is a microRNA (miR) up-regulated in EVs secreted by drug-resistant A549-GR lung cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanism through which miR-221-3p-containing EVs regulate the progression of lung cancer remains elusive. Here, we attempted to reveal the mechanism by which miR-221-3p-containing EVs secreted by drug-resistant lung cancer cells regulate the functions of surrounding cells during the progression of lung cancer. A gemcitabine-sensitive lung cancer cell line was treated with isolated drug-resistant lung cancer EVs followed by an evaluation of the proliferation and migration of sensitive lung cancer cell lines and their resistance to gemcitabine treatment. Moreover, the miR-221-3p target gene HMBOX1 was identified by the Targetscan database while the progression of lung cancer was detected by knocking down miR-221-3p or overexpressing HMBOX1, or by treating sensitive cell lines with Akt/mTOR activator and inhibitor, respectively. Furthermore, an in vivo study was performed to validate the relationship between miR-221-3p and HMBOX1 and their roles in the progression of lung cancer. The proliferation and migration of sensitive lung cancer cell lines and their resistance to drugs were significantly enhanced after the treatment with drug-resistant EVs. Knockdown of miR-221-3p (in the EV of drug-resistant lung cancer or overexpression of HMBOX1 in sensitive lung cancer cell lines) reduced the transformation of sensitive lung cell lines, whereas, the treatment of sensitive lung cell lines with Akt/mTOR activator or inhibitor significantly affected the progression of lung cancer. In vivo experiments further confirmed that miR-221-3p released by drug-resistant lung cancer cells targeted the HMBOX1 to regulate the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway and affected the progression of lung cancer. We conclude that miR-221-3p-containing EVs secreted by drug-resistant lung cancer cells can potentially activate the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway by inhibiting HMBOX1, promoting the progression of lung cancer. The regulation of miR-221-3p represents a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of lung cancer."
2,"Comparison of interleukin-12 with lung cancer and malignant lymphoma undergoing autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Purpose: High-dose chemotherapy with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) has become an important treatment for solid tumors including lung cancer. Methods: We measured IL-12 levels in patients with lung cancer undergoing autologous PBSCT in order to elucidate the role of IL-12 in immune response recovery following stem cell transplantation. Results: Compared to IL-12 levels at 1 week after PBSCT for lung cancer patients, those at 3 weeks were significantly increased (P<0.01). In contrast, serum IL-12 levels in malignant lymphoma patients did not change significantly. There were no significant differences in levels of other cytokines between 1 week and 3 weeks after transplantation in patients with lung cancer. The frequency of helper/inducer T cells was increased in peripheral blood 1 week after transplantation in both lung cancer and malignant lymphoma patients. There was a significant increase in activated T cell numbers following PBSCT. Furthermore, high levels of other activated T cells persisted in the post-PBSCT period in patients with lung cancer and the number of cytotoxic T cells significantly increased. Natural killer (NK) cell numbers also tended to increase, although that of malignant lymphoma was not significant. A strong correlation was observed between serum IL-12 levels and NK cell numbers and interferon-γ levels in lung cancer not but in malignant lymphoma patients. The analysis of transfused PBSC showed that the numbers of granulocyte/macrophage colony-forming units were similar in lung cancer and malignant lymphoma patients. However, the number of CD34+ cells was significantly higher in lung cancer than in malignant lymphoma patients. All of the CD34+ subpopulations were lower in percentage in patients with lung cancer than in patients with malignant lymphoma. In particular, the CD34+ CD33– subpopulation was significantly lower in percentage in lung cancer patients. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that PBSC in lung cancer are potent mediators of anticancer activity and that they might play an immunotherapeutic role against autologous malignant cells."
2,"The effect of anti-cancer and anti-tuberculosis treatments in lung cancer patients with active tuberculosis: a retrospective analysis. Lung tuberculosis (TB) and lung cancer have a complex relationship. Data concerning TB treatment in lung cancer patients are still incomplete. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of anti-cancer and anti-tuberculosis treatments in lung cancer patients with active lung TB. In a retrospective cohort study, lung cancer patients with active lung TB were identified between January 2013 and December 2016. Age- and sex-matched lung cancer patients without tuberculosis were selected as control subjects. Anti-cancer and anti-tuberculosis treatments were administered according to the national guidelines. The clinical courses and responses of lung cancer patients with and without active lung TB were examined and compared. A total of 31 consecutive lung cancer patients were diagnosed with active lung TB. Fifty-one lung cancer patients without TB were enrolled as control subjects. Most patients in the two groups were elderly, had advanced non-small cell lung cancer and had tumor burdens. The anti-cancer treatment completion rate and response rate were not different between two group (87.1% in TB treatment patients vs. 92.2% in lung cancer patients, 77.4% in TB treatment patients vs. 88.2% in lung cancer patients, respectively). The anti-tuberculosis treatment completion rate and success rate was 87.1 and 80.7%. The median survival times were not different between two groups (52 weeks in TB treatment patients vs. 57 weeks in lung cancer patients). The change in Karnofsky performance score was also not different between two groups. The most common side effect in TB treatment patients was liver injury (61.3%). The most serious side effect in TB treatment patients was leukocyte deficiency (9.7% in Grade 3). Both of side effects mentioned above were not different between two groups. Both anti-cancer and anti-tuberculosis treatments can be safely and effectively administered in lung cancer patients with active lung TB. Attention should be paid to the risk of tuberculosis in lung cancer patients in TB high-burden countries."
2,"Optimum diameter threshold for lung nodules at baseline lung cancer screening with low-dose chest CT: exploration of results from the Korean Lung Cancer Screening Project To explore the optimum diameter threshold for solid nodules to define positive results at baseline screening low-dose CT (LDCT) and to compare two-dimensional and volumetric measurement of lung nodules for the diagnosis of lung cancers. We included consecutive participants from the Korean Lung Cancer Screening project between 2017 and 2018. The average transverse diameter and effective diameter (diameter of a sphere with the same volume) of lung nodules were measured by semi-automated segmentation. Diagnostic performances for lung cancers diagnosed within 1 year after LDCT were evaluated using area under receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUCs), sensitivities, and specificities, with diameter thresholds for solid nodules ranging from 6 to 10 mm. The reduction of unnecessary follow-up LDCTs and the diagnostic delay of lung cancers were estimated for each threshold. Fifty-two lung cancers were diagnosed among 10,424 (10,141 men; median age 62 years) participants within 1 year after LDCT. Average transverse (0.980) and effective diameters (0.981) showed similar AUCs (p = .739). Elevating the average transverse diameter threshold from 6 to 9 mm resulted in a significantly increased specificity (91.7 to 96.7%, p < .001), a modest reduction in sensitivity (96.2 to 94.2%, p = .317), a 60.2% estimated reduction of unnecessary follow-up LDCTs, and a diagnostic delay in 1.9% of lung cancers. Elevating the threshold to 10 mm led to a significant reduction in sensitivity (86.5%, p = .025). Elevating the diameter threshold for solid nodules from 6 to 9 mm may lead to a substantial reduction in unnecessary follow-up LDCTs with a small proportion of diagnostic delay of lung cancers. • Elevation of the diameter threshold for solid nodules from 6 to 9 mm can substantially reduce unnecessary follow-up LDCTs with a small proportion of diagnostic delay of lung cancers.;  • The average transverse and effective diameters of lung nodules showed similar performances for the prediction of a lung cancer diagnosis."
2,"The role of general practice in routes to diagnosis of lung cancer in Denmark: a population-based study of general practice involvement, diagnostic activity and diagnostic intervals Lung cancer stage at diagnosis predicts possible curative treatment. In Denmark and the UK, lung cancer patients have lower survival rates than citizens in most other European countries, which may partly be explained by a comparatively longer diagnostic interval in these two countries. In Denmark, a pathway was introduced in 2008 allowing general practitioners (GPs) to refer patients suspected of having lung cancer directly to fast-track diagnostics. However, symptom presentation of lung cancer in general practice is known to be diverse and complex, and systematic knowledge of the routes to diagnosis is needed to enable earlier lung cancer diagnosis in Denmark. This study aims to describe the routes to diagnosis, the diagnostic activity preceding diagnosis and the diagnostic intervals for lung cancer in the Danish setting. We conducted a national registry-based cohort study on 971 consecutive incident lung cancer patients in 2010 using data from national registries and GP questionnaires. GPs were involved in 68.3% of cancer patients’ diagnostic pathways, and 27.4% of lung cancer patients were referred from the GP to fast-track diagnostic work-up. A minimum of one X-ray was performed in 85.6% of all cases before diagnosis. Patients referred through a fast-track route more often had diagnostic X-rays (66.0%) than patients who did not go through fast-track (49.4%). Overall, 33.6% of all patients had two or more X-rays performed during the 90 days before diagnosis. Patients whose symptoms were interpreted as non-alarm symptoms or who were not referred to fast-track were more likely to experience a long diagnostic interval than patients whose symptoms were interpreted as alarm symptoms or who were referred to fast-track. Lung cancer patients followed several diagnostic pathways. The existing fast-track pathway must be supplemented to ensure earlier detection of lung cancer. The high incidence of multiple X-rays warrants a continued effort to develop more accurate lung cancer tests for use in primary care."

In vitro and in vivo gain- and loss-of-function assays were performed to investigate the roles of LARRPM.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The lncRNA LARRPM was expressed at low levels in LUAD tissues and cells. The low expression of LARRPM was correlated with advanced stage and poor survival of patients with LUAD. Functional experiments revealed that LARRPM suppressed LUAD cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted apoptosis. LARRPM also repressed macrophage M2 polarization and infiltration. Taken together, LARRPM significantly restricted LUAD progression in vivo. Mechanistically, LARRPM bound and recruited DNA demethylase TET1 to the promoter of its anti-sense strand gene LINC00240, leading to a decrease in DNA methylation level of the LINC00240 promoter and transcriptional activation of LINC00240. Functional rescue assays suggested that the lncRNA LINC00240 was responsible for the roles of LARRPM in the malignant behavior of LUAD cells. LARRPM decreased the binding of TET1 to the CSF1 promoter, resulting in increased DNA methylation of the CSF1 promoter and transcriptional repression of CSF1, which is responsible for the roles of LARRPM in macrophage M2 polarization and infiltration. The TAMs educated by LUAD cells exerted oncogenic roles, which was negatively regulated by LARRPM expressed in LUAD cells.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">LARRPM restricts LUAD progression through repressing both LUAD cell and macrophages.

2,"Clinical and radiographic differentiation of lung nodules caused by mycobacteria and lung cancer: a case–control study Lung nodules caused by mycobacteria can resemble lung cancer on chest imaging. The advent of lung cancer screening with low-dose Computed Tomography is accompanied by high false-positive rates, making it necessary to establish criteria to differentiate malignant from benign nodules. We conducted a retrospective case–control study of 52 patients with mycobacterial lung nodules and 139 patients with lung cancer, diagnosed between 2010 and 2012. We compared clinical and radiographic characteristics to identify predictors of disease by univariate and multivariate analysis. The discriminatory power of maximum Standardized Uptake Values from Positron-Emission-Tomography was also evaluated. Several variables were correlated with a diagnosis of mycobacterial infection or lung cancer on univariate analysis. Such variable include smoking status and history, lesion size and imaging evidence of tree-in-bud opacities, lymphadenopathy or emphysema on computed tomography. Upon author consensus, the most clinically-relevant variables were selected to undergo multivariate analysis. A history of current or former smoking [OR 4.4 (95 % CI 1.2–15.6) and 2.7 (95 % CI 1.1–6.8), respectively P = 0.04] was correlated with diagnoses of lung cancer. Contrarily, the presence of tree-in-bud opacities was less likely to be correlated with a diagnosis of malignancy [OR 0.04 (95 % CI 0.0–1.0), P = 0.05]. Additionally, higher maximum standardized uptake values from positron emission tomography were associated with malignancy on multivariate analysis [OR 1.1 (95 % CI 1.0–1.2), P = 0.04]; but the accuracy of the values in differentiating between diseases was only 0.67 as measured by the area under the curve. Lesion size was not independently associated with diagnosis [OR 0.5 (95 % CI 0.2–1.2), (P = 0.12)]. Establishing the likelihood of malignancy for lung nodules based on isolated clinical or radiographic criteria is difficult. Using the variables found in this study may allow clinicians to stratify patients into groups of high and low risk for malignancy, and therefore establish efficient diagnostic strategies."
2,"Lung cancer incidence and mortality in relationship to hormone replacement therapy use among women participating in the PLCO trial: a post hoc analysis To evaluate the impact of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the incidence and mortality of lung cancer among female participants in the prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovary (PLCO) trial. All women participating in the PLCO trial with complete information about HRT exposure were included in the current analysis. All study population were aged 55–74 years without prior history of lung cancer at the time of study enrollment. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the impact of HRT exposure on lung cancer incidence and mortality. For both end points, the model was adjusted for: age, body mass index, study arm, race, cigarette smoking and family history of lung cancer. A total of 77,911 female participants were included in the current analysis, including 27,663 participants who never used HRT before inclusion into the PLCO trial and 50,248 participants who used some form of HRT before inclusion into the PLCO trial. Prior exposure to HRT seems to be protective against the development of lung cancer in a multivariate analysis (hazard ratio for ever exposure versus never exposure 0.876; 95% CI 0.783–0.981; P = 0.022). Similarly, prior exposure to HRT seems also to be protective against death from lung cancer in a multivariate analysis (hazard ratio for ever exposure versus never exposure 0.814; 0.709–0.934; P = 0.003). Further multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that current HRT usage at the time of PLCO trial entry (and not former HRT usage) seemed to be protective against lung cancer development (hazard ratio for current versus never users 0.842; 0.743–0.954; P = 0.007) and lung cancer-specific mortality (hazard ratio for current versus never users 0.800; 0.686–0.932; P = 0.004). HRT use at the time of PLCO trial entry seems to be associated with lower probability of lung cancer development and death. Further studies are needed to elucidate the biological mechanisms behind this observation."

2,"Cancer Burden Variations and Convergences in Globalization: A Comparative Study on the Tracheal, Bronchus, and Lung (TBL) and Liver Cancer Burdens Among WHO Regions from 1990 to 2019. Lung cancer and liver cancer are the leading and third causes of cancer death, respectively. Both lung and liver cancer are with clear major risk factors. A thorough understanding of their burdens in the context of globalization, especially the convergences and variations among WHO regions, is useful in precision cancer prevention worldwide and understanding the changing epidemiological trends with the expanding globalization. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) and WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) database were analyzed to evaluate the burden metrics and risk factors of trachea, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer and liver cancer. Western Pacific Region (WPR) had the highest age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) for both liver cancer (11.02 [9.62-12.61] per 100,000 population) and TBL cancer (38.82 [33.63-44.04] per 100,000 population) in 2019. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for liver and TBL cancer elevated with the increasing sociodemographic index (SDI) level, except for liver cancer in WPR and TBL cancer in European Region (EUR). Region of the Americas (AMR) showed the biggest upward trends of liver cancer age-standardized rates (ASRs), as well as the biggest downward trends of TBL cancer ASRs, followed by Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). Alcohol use and smoking were the leading cause of liver and TBL cancer death in most WHO regions. Variances of ASRs for liver and TBL cancer among WHO memberships have been decreasing during the past decade. The homogenization and convergence of cancer burdens were also demonstrated in different agegroups and sexes and in the evolution of associated risk factors and etiology. In conclusion, our study reflects the variations and convergences in the liver and lung cancer burdens among the WHO regions with the developing globalization, which suggests that we need to be acutely aware of the global homogeneity of the disease burden that accompanies increasing globalization, including the global convergences in various populations, risk factors, and burden metrics."
2,"Nomogram based on homogeneous and heterogeneous associated factors for predicting bone metastases in patients with different histological types of lung cancer. The purpose of the present study was to characterize the prevalence, associated factors, and to construct a nomogram for predicting bone metastasis (BM) with different histological types of lung cancer. This study was a descriptive study that basing on the invasive lung cancer patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2014 in Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. A total of 125,652 adult patients were retrieved. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to investigate homogeneous and heterogeneous factors for BM occurrence. Nomogram was constructed to predict the risk for developing BM and the performance was evaluated by the receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC) and the calibration curve. The overall survival of the patients with BM was analyzed using the Kaplan–Meier method and the survival differences were tested by the log-rank test. A total of 25,645 (20.9%) were reported to have BM, and the prevalence in adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, small cell lung cancer (SCLC), large cell lung cancer (LCLC), and non-small cell lung cancer/not otherwise specified lung cancer (NSCLC/NOS) were 24.4, 12.5, 24.7, 19.5 and 19.4%, respectively, with significant difference (P < 0.001). Male gender, more metastatic sites and lymphatic metastasis were positively associated with BM in all lung cancer subtypes. Larger tumor size was positively associated with BM in all the lung cancer subtypes except for NSCLC/NOS. Poorly differentiated histology was positively associated with adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and NSCLC/NOS. The calibration curve and ROC curve exhibited good performance for predicting BM. The median survival of the bone metastatic lung cancer patients was 4.00 (95%CI: 3.89–4.11) months. With the increased number of the other metastatic sites (brain, lung and liver metastasis), the survival significantly decreased (p < 0.001). Different lung cancer histological subtypes exhibited distinct prevalence and homogeneity and heterogeneity associated factors for BM. The nomogram has good calibration and discrimination for predicting BM of lung cancer."
2,"Therapy with un-engineered naïve rat umbilical cord matrix stem cells markedly inhibits growth of murine lung adenocarcinoma Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality despite continuous efforts to find effective treatments. Data from the American Cancer Society indicate that while the overall incidence of lung cancer is declining, it continues to rise in women. Stem cell-based therapy has been an emerging strategy to treat various diseases. The purpose of this paper is to determine the efficacy of an intrinsic anti-cancer effect of rat umbilical cord matrix stem cells (UCMSCs) on lung cancer. A mouse syngeneic lung carcinoma model was used to test the basic ability of UCMSCs to control the growth of lung cancer. Lung tumors were experimentally induced by tail vein administration of Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells derived from the lung of C57BL/6 mouse. Rat UCMSCs were then administered intratracheally five days later or intravenously on days 5 and 7. The tumor burdens were determined by measuring lung weight three weeks after the treatment. Co-culture of rat UCMSCs with LLC significantly attenuated the proliferation of LLC cells as monitored by MTT (3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide), a tetrazole cell proliferation assay, thymidine uptake, and direct cell counts. In vitro colony assays with rat UCMSCs as feeder layers markedly reduced LLC colony size and number. Co-culture of rat UCMSCs with LLCs causes G0/G1 arrest of cancer cells. This is evident in the decrease of cyclin A and CDK2 expression. The in vivo studies showed that rat UCMSC treatment significantly decreased tumor weight and the total tumor mass. Histological study revealed that intratracheally or systemically administered rat UCMSCs homed to tumor areas and survived for at least 3 weeks without any evidence of differentiation or adverse effects. These results indicate that rat UCMSCs alone remarkably attenuate the growth of lung carcinoma cells in vitro and in a mouse syngeneic lung carcinoma graft model and could be used for targeted cytotherapy for lung cancer."
2,"The blood-borne miRNA signature of lung cancer patients is independent of histology but influenced by metastases Objectives: In our previous studies we reported a panel of 24 miRNAs that allowed discrimination between blood of lung tumor patients independent of the histological subtype and blood of healthy controls with an accuracy of 95.4% [94.9%-95.9%]. Here, we now separately analyzed the miRNA expression in blood of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), including squamous cell lung cancer and adenocarcinoma, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients. Patients and methods: In total, we examined the expression levels of 1,205 miRNAs in blood samples from 20 patients from each of the three histological groups and determined differentially expressed miRNAs between histological subtypes and metastatic and non-metastatic lung cancer. We further determined the overlap of miRNAs expressed in each subgroup with the 24-miRNA signature of lung tumor patients. Results: Based on a raw p-value<0.05, only 18 blood-borne miRNAs were differentially expressed between patients with adenocarcinoma and with squamous cell lung carcinoma, 11 miRNAs between adenocarcinoma and SCLC, and 2 between squamous cell lung carcinoma and SCLC. Likewise, the comparison based on a fold change of 1.5 did not reveal major differences of the blood-borne miRNA expression pattern between NSCLC and SCLC. In addition, we found a large overlap between the blood-borne miRNAs detected in the three histological subgroups and the previously described 24-miRNA signature that separates lung cancer patients form controls. We identified several miRNAs that allowed differentiating between metastatic and non-metastatic tumors both in blood of patients with adenocarcinoma and in blood of patients with SCLC. Conclusion: There is a common miRNA expression pattern in blood of lung cancer patients that does not allow a reliable further subtyping into NSCLC or SCLC, or into adenocarcinoma and squamous cell lung cancer. The previously described 24-miRNA signature for lung cancer appears not primarily dependent on histological subtypes. However, metastatic adenocarcinoma and SCLC can be predicted with 75% accuracy."

2,"PDZRN4 suppresses lung adenocarcinoma progression via inhibiting ubiquitin-mediated HIF-1A degradation. Indolent lung cancer is characterized by slow progression, and the patient may die of other causes before it becomes symptomatic. The increasing usage of lung cancer screening technologies has increased the detection of early-stage cancers, improved survival, and reduced mortality, but it also brings overdiagnosis or overtreatment for indolent lung cancer patients. In this study, we performed high-throughput whole-exome sequencing in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) patients with a tumor doubling time of more than 600 days (the indolent group) and another group with a tumor doubling time of less than 30 days (the aggressive group). We identified a novel germline variation in PDZRN4, rs74955204 (p.G121E, c.362 G > A) in the indolent group. The rs74955204 variant resulted in upregulated PDZRN4 expression and was positively correlated with the survival of LUAD patients. We confirmed that overexpression of PDZRN4 inhibits the ubiquitylation of HIF-1A mediated by TRIM28, thus activating HIF-1A-IGFBP3 signaling to promote apoptosis, and inducing NDRG1 to inhibit EGFR-AKT signaling, restricting lung cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. With the EGFR<sup>L858R</sup>-driven lung cancer mouse model as an example, we found that PDZRN4 knockout promoted, whereas PDZRN4 overexpression suppressed LUAD growth in vivo. In addition, recombinant PDZRN4 or screened small molecules retinoic acid showed potent inhibitory effects on EGFR-driven LUAD growth and amelioration of osimertinib resistance. Overall, our findings suggest that targeted PDZRN4 is a potential therapeutic strategy for treating LUAD. Examination of PDZRN4 rs74955204 variant may be an effective approach for the early detection of indolent lung cancer and to avoid overdiagnosis. Graphical Abstract: Germline variation rs74955204 (p.G121E, c.362 G > A) in PDZRN4 significantly upregulated PDZRN4 expression and resulted in indolent growth of LUAD. Overexpressed PDZRN4 inhibits the ubiquitylation of HIF-1A by TRIM28, activating HIF-1A-IGFBP3 signaling to promote apoptosis, and inducing NDRG1 to inhibit EGFR-AKT signaling, thus restricting lung cancer cell growth."
2,"Artificial neural networks improve LDCT lung cancer screening: a comparative validation study. This study proposes a prediction model for the automatic assessment of lung cancer risk based on an artificial neural network (ANN) with a data-driven approach to the low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) standardized structure report. This comparative validation study analysed a prospective cohort from Chiayi Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan. In total, 836 asymptomatic patients who had undergone LDCT scans between February 2017 and August 2018 were included, comprising 27 lung cancer cases and 809 controls. A derivation cohort of 602 participants (19 lung cancer cases and 583 controls) was collected to construct the ANN prediction model. A comparative validation of the ANN and Lung-RADS was conducted with a prospective cohort of 234 participants (8 lung cancer cases and 226 controls). The areas under the curves (AUCs) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the prediction models. At the cut-off of category 3, the Lung-RADS had a sensitivity of 12.5%, specificity of 96.0%, positive predictive value of 10.0%, and negative predictive value of 96.9%. At its optimal cut-off value, the ANN had a sensitivity of 75.0%, specificity of 85.0%, positive predictive value of 15.0%, and negative predictive value of 99.0%. The area under the ROC curve was 0.764 for the Lung-RADS and 0.873 for the ANN (P = 0.01). The two most important predictors used by the ANN for predicting lung cancer were the documented sizes of partially solid nodules and ground-glass nodules. Compared to the Lung-RADS, the ANN provided better sensitivity for the detection of lung cancer in an Asian population. In addition, the ANN provided a more refined discriminative ability than the Lung-RADS for lung cancer risk stratification with population-specific demographic characteristics. When lung nodules are detected and documented in a standardized structured report, ANNs may better provide important insights for lung cancer prediction than conventional rule-based criteria."
2,"Current evidence on the relationship between CYP1B1 polymorphisms and lung cancer risk: a meta-analysis The association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the CYP1B1 gene and lung cancer risk is still ambiguous. In this meta analysis, we assessed 10 case-control studies included 7,067 cases and 9,374 controls of the association between CYP1B1 SNPs of Leu432Val (rs1056836, 432C>G), Asn453Ser (rs1800440, 453A>G), Ala119Ser (rs1056827, 119G>T), Arg48Gly (rs10012, 48C>G) and the risk of lung cancer. Crude odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the strength of association between the polymorphism and lung cancer risk under codominant model, dominant model and additive model respectively. Although there were limitations, this meta analysis indicated that individuals with 432GG genotype had a 39.7% higher risk of having lung cancer than those with the 432CC genotype, and individuals with the 432G allele had a 26.3% increased risk as well. An increased risk of lung cancer of 2.13 fold was observed in individuals with 119TT genotype. For Arg48Gly, individuals with 48GG genotype had a significantly increased risk of lung cancer compared with individuals with 48CC (OR 3.859; 95% CI 2.536-5.87). Elevated risk of lung cancer were observed in dominant model (OR 2.115; 95% CI 1.653-2.705) as well. The risk of lung cancer was elevated as the frequency of G allele increased in additive model (P = 0.000). For individuals with the polymorphism at codon 453, no evidence of such association was observed. Furthermore, a possible association between the CYP1B1 polymorphism at codon 432 and the lung cancer could be detected in individuals of Caucasian origin, while a negative association was suggested in Asians and African-Americans. An increased lung cancer risk was also found in women with polymorphism at codon 453. These results are supportive for the hypothesis that the CYP1B1 432GG, 119TT and 48GG genotypes are low-penetrance risk factors for developing lung cancer, and further studies are needed to validate these associations."
2,"SPECT/CT of lung nodules using 111In-DOTA-c(RGDfK) in a mouse lung carcinogenesis model Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide, including Japan. Although computed tomography (CT) can detect small lung lesions such as those appearing as ground glass opacity, it cannot differentiate between malignant and non-malignant lesions. Previously, we have shown that single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging using 111In-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-N,N′,N′′,N′′′-tetraacetic acid-cyclo-(Arg-Gly-Asp-d-Phe-Lys) (DOTA-c(RGDfK)), an imaging probe of αvβ3 integrin, is useful for the early detection of pancreatic cancer in a hamster pancreatic carcinogenesis model. In this study, we aimed to assess the usefulness of SPECT/CT with 111In-DOTA-c(RGDfK) for the evaluation of the malignancy of lung cancer. Lung tumors were induced by a single intraperitoneal injection (250 mg/kg) of urethane in male A/J mice. Twenty-six weeks after the urethane treatment, SPECT was performed an hour after injection of 111In-DOTA-c(RGDfK). Following this, the radioactivity ratios of tumor to normal lung tissue were measured by autoradiography (ARG) in the excised lung samples. We also examined the expression of αvβ3 integrin in mouse and human lung samples. Urethane treatment induced 5 hyperplasias, 41 adenomas and 12 adenocarcinomas in the lungs of 8 A/J mice. SPECT with 111In-DOTA-c(RGDfK) could clearly visualize lung nodules, though we failed to detect small lung nodules like adenoma and hyperplasias (adenocarcinoma: 66.7 %, adenoma: 33.6 %, hyperplasia: 0.0 %). ARG analysis revealed significant uptake of 111In-DOTA-c(RGDfK) in all the lesions. Moreover, tumor to normal lung tissue ratios increased along with the progression of carcinogenesis. Histopathological examination using human lung tissue samples revealed clear up-regulation of αvβ3 integrin in well-differentiated adenocarcinoma (Noguchi type B and C) rather than atypical adenomatous hyperplasia. Although there are some limitations in evaluating the malignancy of small lung tumors using 111In-DOTA-c(RGDfK), SPECT with 111In-DOTA-c(RGDfK) might be a useful non-invasive imaging approach for evaluating the characteristics of lung tumors in mice, thus showing potential for use in humans."

Subsequently, prognosis significance and immune cell infiltration were analyzed by Kaplan-Meier plotter and CIBERSORT. 60 pairs of local NSCLC tissues were involved to validate WT1 expression by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Western blot. Moreover, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), colony formation, transwell, dual luciferase reporter assays and in vivo xenograft tumour growth experiments were conducted to explore the function and mechanism of WT1 in NSCLC.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Our solid data indicated that WT1 was increased in NSCLC tissues and cell lines in comparison with their matched controls. In particular, its upregulation correlated with worse prognosis and immune infiltration of the patients. Functional assays demonstrated that knockdown of WT1 inhibited NSCLC malignancy, including inhibiting cell proliferation, survival and invasion. Further exploration discovered that microRNA-498-5p (miR-498-5p) was the upstream suppressor of WT1 by directly targeting the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of WT1 mRNA. Moreover, expression of miR-498-5p was notably decreased and inversely correlated with WT1 in NSCLC tissues. Finally, we proved that miR-498-5p was a potent tumour suppressor in NSCLC by suppressing cell proliferation, survival and invasion, while WT1 restoration could in turn disrupt this suppression both in vitro and in vivo.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">The abnormal increase in WT1 contributes to the malignant properties of NSCLC cells, and miR-498-5p is a natural inhibitor of WT1.

2,"Metal concentrations in lung tissue of subjects suffering from lung cancer. Concentrations of nine metals (Fe, Ca, Mg, Zn, Cu, Co, Ni, Pb and Cr) concentrations in lung tissues from 224 lung cancer cases were compared with those in other cases to achieve an understanding of their contribution to the development of lung cancer and the varieties after the development of cancer. Comparisons of metal concentrations in each cell type of lung cancer were also performed. All cases were collected from routine autopsies in Tokyo and Saitama, Japan. The copper concentration in tissue from lung cancers was significantly higher than that in other specimens, although calcium, magnesium, zinc and cobalt concentrations in lung cancers were significantly lower than those in other cases. There were no significant differences in the 99% intervals (excluding extremely high values for occupationally exposed cases) for chromium, nickel and lead concentrations between lung cancers and other cases, although these values were lower in lung cancers. However, in comparisons of men only, the chromium concentration, the degree of lung contamination and the severity of pulmonary emphysema in lung cancer cases were significantly higher than those in other specimens. Moreover, percentages of lung cancer in men at each degree of contamination and each severity of emphysema increased with increasing grades. Thus, this finding could be evidence that the exposure to contaminants other than chromium and nickel in the air had affected the development of lung cancer, except for occupationally exposed individuals. Therefore, almost all chromium and nickel in lung tissue might not deposit in carcinogenic forms such as hexavalent chromium or nickel subsulfide. Comparison of the characteristics in each cell type of lung cancer revealed that calcium and chromium concentrations in lung tissue (not including tumor) or squamous cell carcinomas were higher than those in the other cell types. In small cell carcinomas, calcium magnesium and zinc concentrations were low."
2,"MicroRNA-218 functions as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer by targeting IL-6/STAT3 and negatively correlates with poor prognosis Aberrant expression of microRNAs in different human cancer types has been widely reported. MiR-218 acts as a tumor suppressor in diverse human cancer types impacting regulation of multiple genes in oncogenic pathways. Here, we evaluated the expression and function of miR-218 in human lung cancer and ALDH positive lung cancer cells to understand the potential mechanisms responsible for disease pathology. Also, the association between its host genes and the target genes could be useful towards the better understanding of prognosis in clinical settings. Publicly-available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) was mined to compare the levels of miR-218 and its host gene SLIT2/3 between lung cancer tissues and normal lung tissues. Transfection of miR-218 to investigate its function in lung cancer cells was done and in vivo effects were determined using miR-218 expressing lentiviruses. Aldefluor assay and Flow cytometry was used to quantify and enrich ALDH positive lung cancer cells. Levels of miR-218, IL-6R, JAK3 and phosphorylated STAT3 were compared in ALDH1A1 positive and ALDH1A1 negative cells. Overexpression of miR-218 in ALDH positive cells was carried to test the survival by tumorsphere culture. Finally, utilizing TCGA data we studied the association of target genes of miR-218 with the prognosis of lung cancer. We observed that the expression of miR-218 was significantly down-regulated in lung cancer tissues compared to normal lung tissues. Overexpression of miR-218 decreased cell proliferation, invasion, colony formation, and tumor sphere formation in vitro and repressed tumor growth in vivo. We further found that miR-218 negatively regulated IL-6 receptor and JAK3 gene expression by directly targeting the 3′-UTR of their mRNAs. In addition, the levels of both miR-218 host genes and the components of IL-6/STAT3 pathway correlated with prognosis of lung cancer patients. MiR-218 acts as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer via IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway regulation."

2,"Benzyl isothiocyanate induces protective autophagy in human lung cancer cells through an endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated mechanism Isothiocyanates, such as allyl isothiocya¬nate (AITC), benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC), phenethyl isothio¬cyanate (PEITC) and sulforaphane (SFN), are natural compounds abundant in cruciferous vegetables, which have substantial chemopreventive activities against various human malignancies. However, the mechanisms underlying the inhibition of tumor cell growth by isothiocyanates are not fully understood. Since autophagy has dual functions in cancer, in the present study we investigated the effects of BITC on autophagy induction in human lung cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. BITC (1–100 μmol/L) dose-dependently inhibited the growth of 3 different human lung cancer cell lines A549 (adenocarcinoma), H661 (large cell carcinoma) and SK-MES-1 (squamous cell carcinoma) with IC50 values of 30.7±0.14, 15.9±0.22 and 23.4±0.11 μmol/L, respectively. BITC (10–40 μmol/L) induced autophagy in the lung cancer cells, evidenced by the formation of acidic vesicular organelles (AVOs), the accumulation of LC3-II, the punctate pattern of LC3, and the expression of Atg5. Pretreatment with the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA (5 mmol/L) significantly enhanced the BITC-caused growth inhibition in the lung cancer cells. Furthermore, BITC (20–40 μmol/L) activated ER stress, as shown by the increased cytosolic Ca2+ level and the phosphorylation of the ER stress marker proteins PERK and eIF2α in the lung cancer cells. Pretreatment with the ER stress inhibitor 4-PBA (5 mmol/L) attenuated the autophagy induction and potentiated the BITC-induced cell growth inhibition. In nude mice bearing A549 xenografts, administration of BITC (100 mg·kg-1·d-1, ip) for 8 weeks markedly suppressed the lung tumor growth, and significantly enhanced both autophagy and ER stress in the tumor tissues. Our results demonstrate that BITC inhibits human lung cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. In addition, BITC induces autophagy in the lung cancer cells, which protects the cancer cells against the inhibitory action of BITC; the autophagy induction is mediated by the ER stress response."
2,"Inhibition of ASAP1 Modulates the Tumor Immune Microenvironment and Suppresses Lung Cancer Metastasis via the p-STAT3 Signaling Pathway. ADP ribosylation factor guanylate kinase 1 (ASAP1), a key protein regulating cell migration and invasion, has attracted extensive attention in oncological research in recent years. This study aims to explore the effects of ASAP1 inhibition on lung cancer metastasis and its potential mechanisms, particularly how it modulates the tumor immune microenvironment through the p-STAT3 signaling pathway. In this study, shRNA technology was employed to specifically inhibit ASAP1 expression in lung cancer cell lines A549, NCI-H1299, and PC-9. The effects of ASAP1 inhibition on lung cancer cell viability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion were evaluated using CCK-8, TUNEL apoptosis detection, and cell migration and invasion assays. Furthermore, animal experiments were conducted to assess the in vivo effects of ASAP1 inhibition on lung cancer metastasis, and immunohistochemical analysis was performed to investigate changes in immune cells in lung metastasis models, further exploring its impact on the tumor immune microenvironment. The experimental results demonstrated that ASAP1 inhibition significantly reduced lung cancer cell viability, induced apoptosis in A549, NCI-H1299, and PC-9 cells, and suppressed the migration and invasion abilities of these cells. In vivo experiments revealed that ASAP1 inhibition effectively suppressed lung cancer metastasis and altered the tumor immune microenvironment by regulating immune cells. Moreover, we found that ASAP1 inhibition could decrease tumor cell proliferation and induce tumor apoptosis in lung metastasis models by inhibiting the p-STAT3 signaling pathway. This study confirms that ASAP1 inhibition can suppress lung cancer metastasis by modulating the tumor immune microenvironment through the inhibition of the p-STAT3 signaling pathway. These findings provide new targets for lung cancer treatment and a theoretical basis for developing novel strategies against lung cancer metastasis. Future research will further explore the mechanisms of ASAP1 in lung cancer metastasis and how to optimize treatment strategies for lung cancer patients by targeting ASAP1."
2,"Current lung cancer screening guidelines may miss high-risk population: a real-world study. Despite much research published on lung cancer screening, China has had no large-scale study on the missed diagnosis of lung cancer in a health examination population. We therefore did a real-world study using the current lung cancer screening guidelines to a health examination population in China to determine the proportion of lung cancer cases that have been missed. A real-world cohort study of screening, with the use of low-dose computed tomography, was conducted among people who took yearly health checkup in health management center of West China Hospital between 2006 and 2017. We respectively used current guidelines including lung cancer screening guidelines of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and expert consensus on low dose spiral CT lung cancer screening in China. In a total of 15,996 participants with health examination who completed the baseline screening, 6779 (42.4%) subjects had at least one positive finding, and 142 (2.1%) cases of lung cancer were screened positive. The false positive rate was 97.9%. Of 142 lung cancer cases detected in our study, only 9.2% met the lung cancer screening guidelines proposed by the USPSTF, and 24.4% met that of China. The rates of missed diagnosis were as high as 90.8 and 75.6% respectively. In addition, we did an in-depth analysis by gender. We found that among male patients with lung cancer, the proportion of smokers was 75%, and the proportion of young people under 50 was 23.2%. Among female patients with lung cancer, the proportion of smokers was only 5.8%, and the proportion of young people under 50 was up to 33.3%. The rate of missed diagnosis was as high as 90.8% applying the current lung cancer screening guidelines to the health examination population in China. Further study to determine screening guidelines for targeted populations, is warranted."
2,"Phenethyl isothiocyanate inhibits metastasis potential of non-small cell lung cancer cells through FTO mediated TLE1 m6A modification. N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) modification is a prevalent RNA epigenetic modification, which plays a crucial role in tumor progression including metastasis. Isothiocyanates (ITCs) are natural compounds and inhibit the tumorigenesis of various cancers. Our previous studies show that ITCs inhibit the proliferation and metastasis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, and have synergistic effects with chemotherapy drugs. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of ITCs on cancer cell metastasis. We showed that phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) dose-dependently inhibited the cell viability of both NSCLC cell lines H1299 and H226 with IC<sub>50</sub> values of 17.6 and 15.2 μM, respectively. Furthermore, PEITC dose-dependently inhibited the invasion and migration of H1299 and H226 cells. We demonstrated that PEITC treatment dose-dependently increased m<sup>6</sup>A methylation levels and inhibited the expression of the m<sup>6</sup>A demethylase fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO) in H1299 and H226 cells. Knockdown of FTO significantly increased m<sup>6</sup>A methylation in H1299 and H226 cells, impaired their abilities of invasion and migration in vitro, and enhanced the inhibition of PEITC on tumor growth in vivo. Overexpression of FTO promoted the migration of NSCLC cells, and also mitigated the inhibitory effect of PEITC on migration of NSCLC cells. Furthermore, we found that FTO regulated the mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A modification of a transcriptional co-repressor Transducin-Like Enhancer of split-1 (TLE1) and further affected its stability and expression. TCGA database analysis revealed TLE1 was upregulated in NSCLC tissues compared to normal tissues, which might be correlated with the metastasis status. Moreover, we showed that PEITC suppressed the migration of NSCLC cells by inhibiting TLE1 expression and downstream Akt/NF-κB pathway. This study reveals a novel mechanism underlying ITC's inhibitory effect on metastasis of lung cancer cells, and provided valuable information for developing new therapeutics for lung cancer by targeting m<sup>6</sup>A methylation."
2,"An immunohistochemical study of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) expression in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC): a possible prognostic biomarker. Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) is an atypical CDK which plays a vital role in several cancers via regulating migration and motility of cancer cells. However, the clinicopathological impact and function of CDK5 in lung cancer remain poorly understood. The present study was aimed at exploring expression and clinicopathological significance of CDK5 in lung cancer. There were 395 samples of lung tissue including 365 lung tumors (339 non-small cell lung cancers and 26 small cell lung cancers) and 30 samples of normal lung. CDK5 expression was detected by immunohistochemistry on lung tissue microarrays. Over expression was detected in lung cancer compared with normal lung tissues (P = 0.001). Furthermore, area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of CDK5 was 0.685 (95 % CI 0.564~0.751, P = 0.004). In lung cancer, we also discovered close correlations between CDK5 and pathological grading (r = 0.310, P < 0.001), TNM stage (r = 0.155, P = 0.003), and lymph node metastasis (r = 0.279, P < 0.001) by using Spearman analysis. In two subgroups of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC), the expression of CDK5 was also higher than that of normal lung tissue, respectively (P = 0.001 and P = 0.004). Moreover, in NSCLCs, Spearman analysis revealed that expression of CDK5 was correlated with TNM stages (r = 0.129, P = 0.017), lymph node metastasis (r = 0.365, P < 0.001), and pathological grading (r = 0.307, P < 0.001), respectively. The significant correlation was also found between CDK5 expression and TNM stages (r = 0.415, P = 0.049) and lymphatic metastasis (r = 0.469, P = 0.024) in SCLCs. The results of this present study suggest that the CDK5 expression is associated with several clinicopathological factors linked with poorer prognosis."
2,"Hdac7 promotes lung tumorigenesis by inhibiting Stat3 activation Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying lung cancer development have not been fully understood. The functions of histone deacetylases (HDACs), a class of total eighteen proteins (HDAC1–11 and SIRT1–7 in mammals) that deacetylate histones and non-histone proteins, in cancers are largely unknown. Hdac7;  +/−/K-Ras mice and HDAC7-depleted human lung cancer cell lines were used as models for studying the function of Hdac7 gene in lung cancer. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to explore the relationship between HDAC7 expression and prognosis of human lung cancers. Recombinant lentivirus-mediated in vivo gene expression or knockdown, Western blotting, and pull-down assay were applied to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism by which Hdac7 promotes lung tumorigenesis. The number and burden of lung tumor were dramatically reduced in Hdac7;  +/−/K-Ras mice compared to control K-Ras mice. Also, in Hdac7;  +/−/K-Ras mice, cell proliferation was significantly inhibited and apoptosis in lung tumors was greatly enhanced. Similarly, cell proliferation and anchorage-independent growth of human lung cancer cell lines expressing shHDAC7 were also significantly suppressed and apoptosis was dramatically elevated respectively. Mechanistic study revealed that Hdac7 mutation in mouse lung tumors or HDAC7 depletion in human tumor cell lines resulted in significantly enhanced acetylation and tyrosine-phosphorylation of Stat3 and HDAC7 protein directly interacted with and deacetylateed STAT3. The Hdac7 mutant-mediated inhibitory effects on lung tumorigenesis in mice and cell proliferation/soft agar colony formation of human lung cancer cell lines were respectively reversed by expressing dnStat3. Finally, the high HDAC7 mRNA level was found to be correlated with poor prognosis of human lung cancer patients. Our study suggests that Hdac7 promotes lung tumorigenesis by inhibiting Stat3 activation via deacetylating Stat3 and may shed a light on the design of new therapeutic strategies for human lung cancer."
2,"Expression of the candidate tumor suppressor gene hSRBC is frequently lost in primary lung cancers with and without DNA methylation. Recently, the human SRBC (hSRBC) gene, a candidate tumor suppressor gene (TSG), has been mapped to the chromosomal region 11p 15.5--p15.4 where frequent allele loss has been described in lung cancer. Aberrant methylation (referred to as methylation) of the promoter region of TSGs has been identified as an important mechanism for gene silencing. Loss of hSRBC protein expression occurs frequently in lung cancer cell lines and sodium bisulfite sequencing of the promoter region of hSRBC in several lung cancer cell lines suggested that methylation plays an important role in inactivating hSRBC. To determine the methylation status of hSRBC in a large collection of primary lung cancer samples, corresponding nonmalignant lung tissues and lung cancer cell lines (N=52), we designed primers for a methylation-specific PCR assay. Methylation was detected in 41% of primary non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC) (N=107) and in 80% of primary small-cell lung cancers (SCLC) (N=5), but was seen only in 4% of corresponding nonmalignant lung tissues (N=103). In all, 79% of lung cancer cell lines were methylated and the frequency of hSRBC methylation was significantly higher in SCLC (100%) than in NSCLC (58%) cell lines. Normal hSRBC protein expression was detected in only 18% of primary NSCLCs (N=93) by immunostaining and a significant association between loss of protein expression and methylation was found. hSRBC re-expression was observed after treatment of lung cancer cells with the demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. In addition, 45% of the 76 hSRBC immunostaining-negative NSCLCs did not have hSRBC promoter methylation, indicating that other mechanisms of hSRBC expression silencing also exist. Both hSRBC immunostaining and methylation results did not correlate with clinicopathological characteristics of these patients. Our findings suggest that hSRBC is a candidate TSG involved in lung cancer pathogenesis, where expression is frequently inactivated by methylation and other mechanisms."
2,"Comprehensive analysis of competitive endogenous RNA associated with immune infiltration in lung adenocarcinoma. To identify the prognostic biomarker of the competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) and explore the tumor infiltrating immune cells (TIICs) which might be the potential prognostic factors in lung adenocarcinoma. In addition, we also try to explain the crosstalk between the ceRNA and TIICs to explore the molecular mechanisms involved in lung adenocarcinoma. The transcriptome data of lung adenocarcinoma were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, and the hypergeometric correlation of the differently expressed miRNA-lncRNA and miRNA-mRNA were analyzed based on the starBase. In addition, the Kaplan–Meier survival and Cox regression model analysis were used to identify the prognostic ceRNA network and TIICs. Correlation analysis was performed to analysis the correlation between the ceRNA network and TIICs. In the differently expressed RNAs between tumor and normal tissue, a total of 190 miRNAs, 224 lncRNAs and 3024 mRNAs were detected, and the constructed ceRNA network contained 5 lncRNAs, 92 mRNAs and 10 miRNAs. Then, six prognostic RNAs (FKBP3, GPI, LOXL2, IL22RA1, GPR37, and has-miR-148a-3p) were viewed as the key members for constructing the prognostic prediction model in the ceRNA network, and three kinds of TIICs (Monocytes, Macrophages M1, activated mast cells) were identified to be significantly related with the prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma. Correlation analysis suggested that the FKBP3 was associated with Monocytes and Macrophages M1, and the GPI was obviously related with Monocytes and Macrophages M1. Besides, the LOXL2 was associated with Monocytes and Activated mast cells, and the IL22RA1 was significantly associated with Monocytes and Macrophages M1, while the GPR37 and Macrophages M1 was closely related. The constructed ceRNA network and identified Monocytes, Macrophages M1 and activated Mast cells are all prognostic factors for lung adenocarcinoma. Moreover, the crosstalk between the ceRNA network and TIICs might be a potential molecular mechanism involved."

2,"Pulmonary cryptococcosis coexisting with central type lung cancer in an immuocompetent patient: a case report and literature review Pulmonary Cryptococcosis is a common fungal infection mainly caused by Cryptococcus neoformans/C.gattii species in immunocompromised patients. Cases of pulmonary cryptococcosis in patients with normal immune function are increasingly common in China. Clinical and radiographic features of pulmonary cryptococcosis are various and without obvious characteristics, so it is often misdiagnosed as pulmonary metastatic tumor or tuberculosis. When coexisting with malignant lung tumors, it was more difficult to differentiate from metastatic lung cancer, although the coexistence of pulmonary cryptococcosis and central type lung cancer is rare. Reviewing the imaging manifestations and diagnosis of the case and the relevant literature will contribute to recognition of the disease and a decrease in misdiagnoses. A 72-year-old immunocompetent Han Chinese man had repeated dry cough for more than half a year. CT examination of chest showed an irregular mass at the left hilum of the lung, and two small nodules in the right lung, which were considered as the left central lung cancer with right lung metastasis. However, the patient was diagnosed with pulmonary cryptococcosis coexisting with central type lung cancer based on the results of laboratory examination, percutaneous lung biopsy, fiberoptic bronchoscopy, and surgical pathology. The patient underwent surgical resection of the left central type lung cancer and was placed on fluconazole treatment after a positive diagnosis was made. Five years after the lung cancer surgery, the patient had a recurrence, but the pulmonary cryptococcus nodule disappeared. Our case shows that CT findings of central type lung cancer with multiple pulmonary nodules are not necessarily metastases, but may be coexisting pulmonary cryptococcosis. CT images of cryptococcosis of the lung were diverse and have no obvious characteristics, so it was very difficult to distinguish from metastatic tumors. CT-guided percutaneous lung biopsy was a simple and efficient method for identification."
2,"Spatio-temporal Distribution Characteristics and Environmental Impact Factors of Lung Cancer Mortality: A Case Study of Yuhui District in Bengbu City, China Among cancers, lung cancer is the most common cause of death in China. For the prevention and control of lung cancer, it is necessary to investigate the spatial and temporal distribution of lung cancer mortality, as well as the changes in the trend and the affecting mechanism. Based on statistics and auto-correlation analysis, this paper studied the spatial and temporal distribution of lung cancer mortality in Yuhui District, Bengbu, Huaihe River Basin, from 2017 to 2020. In addition, Spearman’s Rank Correlation Assessment Model and Geographic Detector Model were used to examine the relationship between environmental factors and lung cancer mortality to identify impact factors and their mechanisms. The findings indicated that: 1) from the characteristics of temporal distribution, the number of lung cancer deaths exhibited a linear growth tendency, with the highest mortality in winter; 2) from the characteristics of spatial distribution, lung cancer mortality showed a strong spatial agglomeration form, concentrating on two clustering areas, located in the old city and the central city of Bengbu, near the Huaihe River; 3) from the point of view of the whole research area, there were 15 impact factors with significant correlation in the built and natural environment factors. The significant impacting factors in the built environment included land use, road traffic, spatial form and blue-green space, which could indirectly affect lung cancer mortality, while air pollution and temperature constituted the significant impacting factors in the natural environment; 4) the influence of screened environmental factors on lung cancer mortality was different. Spatial stratified heterogeneity assessment, the interaction among environmental factors demonstrated statistical significance, it was found that the interaction between environmental factors in pairs had a significant enhancement effect on lung cancer mortality. To some extent, urban planning and policies could reduce lung cancer mortality."
2,"Methylation of the DCLK1 promoter region in circulating free DNA and its prognostic value in lung cancer patients. The possibility of detection of suppressor genes methylation in circulating free DNA (cf-DNA) of cancer patients and the lack of methylation in healthy individuals makes this epigenetic alternation an ideal diagnostic marker of neoplastic processes. Moreover, hypermethylation in several genes promoter was described as a biomarker of lung cancer. Methylation in the gene encoding doublecortin-like kinase 1 (DCLK1) is observed in patients with colorectal cancer and cholangiocarcinoma. However, there are no studies concerning DCLK1 methylation in lung cancer patients. The aims of the study was to evaluate the frequency of DCLK1 promoter methylation in cf-DNA of lung cancer patients and of healthy persons as well as the usefulness of this test for predicting the lung cancer course. DCLK1 methylation status was evaluated in DNA isolated from peripheral blood plasma from 65 lung cancer patients and 95 healthy individuals. After DNA bisulfitation, DCLK1 methylation was determined using the qMSP-PCR technique. Moreover, the presence of DCLK1 methylation was correlated with the overall survival (OS) probability of lung cancer patients. DCLK1 promoter methylation was detected in 32 lung cancer patients (49.2 %) and 8 healthy individuals (8.4 %). The methylation of the region before transcription start site (TSS) and the region after TSS of DCLK1 gene was detected in 28 and 11 patients, respectively. In seven cases (10.8 %), the DCLK1 promoter methylation in both regions was reported simultaneously. The methylation was observed slightly frequently in patients with small cell lung cancer (75 % of SCLC patients). The median overall survival of patients with DCLK1 promoter methylation was lower than that of patients without DCLK1 gene modification (p = <0.001, HR = 4.235). The evaluation of DCLK1 promoter region methylation may be useful in both early diagnosis and prediction of the course of lung cancer."
2,"Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase activity in pulmonary alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes from lung cancer and noncancer patients: a correlation with family histories of cancer. Aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) activity was measured in pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and peripheral blood lymphocytes from cigarette smokers with and without primary lung cancer. Frequency distribution analysis of AHH induction ratios for the two groups revealed an increased number of individuals in the lung cancer patient group with high lymphocyte induction values (P less than 0.05). A similar increase was not shown for high-PAM AHH values in lung cancer patients (P greater than 0.2). When individual PAM and lymphocyte AHH values were compared between noncancer and lung cancer patients, a positive correlation was observed for noncancer patients (r=0.195, P less than 0.001), but no correlation of these values was noted for lung cancer patients. The lung cancer patients were divided into three subgroups of patients showing (I) high PAM and low lymphocyte AHH levels, (II) low PAM and low lymphocyte AHH levels, and (III) low PAM and high lymphocyte AHH levels. When the incidence of family history of cancer was compared for these subgroups, no family cancer history was recorded for persons in subgroup II; however, individuals in subgroups I and III presented family cancer history incidence of 9.5% and 39.3%, respectively. Patients in group III averaged 6 years younger than those in group I. These data suggest that familial factors may be identified among lung cancer patients and that these factors appear to associate as either a cause of an effect with the capacity of pulmonary alveolar macrophages and lymphocytes to be induced for AHH. The data support the hypothesis that high AHH values may be characteristic of lung cancer patients but show that enzyme values determined from a single tissue, either PAMs or lymphocytes, may not be appropriate for showing whether high AHH inducibility is correlated with lung cancer."
2,"Performance comparison of two commercial human whole-exome capture systems on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung adenocarcinoma samples Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) has become a valuable tool for molecular landscape characterization of cancer genomes, leading to a better understanding of tumor onset and progression, and opening new avenues in translational oncology. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue is the method of choice for storage of clinical samples, however low quality of FFPE genomic DNA (gDNA) can limit its use for downstream applications. To investigate the FFPE specimen suitability for NGS analysis and to establish the performance of two solution-based exome capture technologies, we compared the whole-exome sequencing (WES) data of gDNA extracted from 5 fresh frozen (FF) and 5 matched FFPE lung adenocarcinoma tissues using: SeqCap EZ Human Exome v.3.0 (Roche NimbleGen) and SureSelect XT Human All Exon v.5 (Agilent Technologies). Sequencing metrics on Illumina HiSeq were optimal for both exome systems and comparable among FFPE and FF samples, with a slight increase of PCR duplicates in FFPE, mainly in Roche NimbleGen libraries. Comparison of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) between FFPE-FF pairs reached overlapping values >90 % in both systems. Both WES showed high concordance with target re-sequencing data by Ion PGM™ in 22 lung-cancer genes, regardless the source of samples. Exon coverage of 623 cancer-related genes revealed high coverage efficiency of both kits, proposing WES as a valid alternative to target re-sequencing. High-quality and reliable data can be successfully obtained from WES of FFPE samples starting from a relatively low amount of input gDNA, suggesting the inclusion of NGS-based tests into clinical contest. In conclusion, our analysis suggests that the WES approach could be extended to a translational research context as well as to the clinic (e.g. to study rare malignancies), where the simultaneous analysis of the whole coding region of the genome may help in the detection of cancer-linked variants."
2,"Recent developments in the field of radiotherapy for the management of lung cancer. Lung cancer has a poor prognosis, and further improvements in outcomes are needed. Radiotherapy plays an important role in the treatment of unresectable lung cancer, and there have been recent developments in the field of radiotherapy for the management of lung cancer. However, to date, there have been few reviews on the improvement in treatment outcomes associated with high precision radiotherapy for lung cancer. Thus, this review aimed to summarize the recent developments in radiotherapy techniques and indicate the future directions in the use of radiotherapy for lung cancer. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for unresectable stage I lung cancer has been reported to improve local control rates without severe adverse events, such as radiation pneumonitis. For locally advanced lung cancer, a combination of chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant immune checkpoint inhibitors dramatically improves treatment outcomes, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) enables safer radiation therapy with less frequent pneumonitis. Particle beam therapy, such as carbon-ion radiotherapy and proton beam therapy, has been administered as advanced medical care for patients with lung cancer. Since 2024, it has been covered under insurance for early stage lung cancer with tumors ≤ 5 cm in size in Japan. In addition to chemotherapy, local ablative radiotherapy improves treatment outcomes in patients with oligometastatic stage IV lung cancer. A particular problem with radiotherapy for lung cancer is that the target location changes with respiratory motion, and various physical methods have been used to control respiratory motion. Recently, coronavirus disease has had a major impact on lung cancer treatment, and cancer treatment during situations, such as the coronavirus pandemic, must be performed carefully. To improve treatment outcomes for lung cancer, it is necessary to fully utilize evolving radiotherapy modalities, and the role of radiotherapy in lung cancer treatment is expected to increase."

2,"Comparative Study of CT Images of Cerebral Metastasis from Pulmonary Squamous Cell Carcinoma and Adenocarcinoma To explore the difference of CT images of metastatic tumors to the brain of lung squamous cell cancer and lung glandular cancer. Forty-five cases of lung squamous cell cancer and 59 cases of lung glandular cancer have gone through pathological confirmation and all the 104 cases have been put under enhanced scanning on the basis of flat scanning. The shape and density of the metastatic tumors, encephaledema around the tumors, and the reinforcement change after the enhancement were analyzed. The CT scanning images of all the cases showed that, under flat scanning, the density of the metastatic tumors to the brain of lung squamous cell cancer was over the slightly-high level and by no means even. Again, under flat scanning, some 10 cases of metastatic tumors to the brain of lung glandular cancer showed a slightly-high density and some 49 other cases a low density and sack-like low density. Forty-five cases of metastatic tumors to the brain of lung squamous cell cancer were with hydroncus while some 30 cases of that of lung glandular cancer were in the same condition. Most of the two types of metastatic tumors, amounting to 97 cases, took place in supratentorial manner, and only 7 cases took place in subtentorial manner. The CT images of metastatic tumors to the brain of lung squamous cell cancer and lung glandular cancer are obviously different from each other. As for the lung squamous cell cancer, the flat scanning density of the tumor is over the slightly-high level with unevenness. There is relatively obvious reinforcement and obvious hydroncus. As for the lung glandular cancer, the metastatic tumor to the brain shows a low density and sack-like low density under flat scanning. There is no obvious reinforcement and relatively slight hydroncus."
2,"Secular trend analysis of lung cancer incidence in Sihui city, China between 1987 and 2011 Background: With industrial and economic development in recent decades in South China, cancer incidence may have changed due to the changing lifestyle and environment. However, the trends of lung cancer and the roles of smoking and other environmental risk factors in the development of lung cancer in rural areas of South China remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to explore the lung cancer incidence trends and the possible causes of these trends. Methods: Joinpoint regression analysis and the age-period-cohort (APC) model were used to analyze the lung cancer incidence trends in Sihui, Guangdong province, China between 1987 and 2011, and explore the possible causes of these trends. Results: A total of 2,397 lung cancer patients were involved in this study. A 3-fold increase in the incidence of lung cancer in both sexes was observed over the 25-year period. Joinpoint regression analysis showed that while the incidence continued to increase steadily in females during the entire period, a sharp acceleration was observed in males starting in 2005. The full APC model was selected to describe age, period, and birth cohort effects on lung cancer incidence trends in Sihui. The age cohorts in both sexes showed a continuously significant increase in the relative risk (RR) of lung cancer, with a peak in the eldest age group (80-84 years). The RR of lung cancer showed a fluctuating curve in both sexes. The birth cohorts identified an increased trend in both males and females; however, males had a plateau in the youngest cohorts who were born during 1955-1969. Conclusions: Increasing trends of the incidence of lung cancer in Sihui were dominated by the effects of age and birth cohorts. Social aging, smoking, and environmental changes may play important roles in such trends."

However, prognosis for patients with lung adenocarcinoma still remains unsatisfactory. It is of extremely importance to find ideal prognostic indicators to predict the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients, especially for patients with early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the significance of Insulin-like growth factor receptor 1 (IGFR1) and Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) expression in predicting progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">In this study, IGFR1 and VEGF-A expression on 119 specimens of patients early and locally advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma were analyzed by immunohistochemistry with an H-score system.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Both high IGFR1 expression and VEGF-A expression patients were resulted in 59 (49.6%) separately.

2,"RAGE acts as an oncogenic role and promotes the metastasis of human lung cancer. RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end-product) is thought to be associated with metastasis and poor prognosis of various types of cancer. However, RAGE is constitutively expressed in the normal lung and down-regulated in cancerous lung, while the opposite evidence shows that RAGE-mediated signaling contributes to the tumorigenesis of lung cancer. Therefore, the role of RAGE in lung cancer progression is still unclear to be further investigated. In this study, RAGE-overexpressed stable clones of human lung cancer A549 cells and two local lung adenocarcinoma cell lines CL1-0 and CL1-5 were utilized to verify the effect of RAGE on lung cancer cells while the in vivo xenograft animal model was further performed to evaluate the role of RAGE in the progression of lung cancer. The growth of A549 cells was inhibited by RAGE overexpression. p53-dependent p21CIP1 expression contributed to RAGE-induced growth inhibition by suppressing CDK2 kinase activity and retinoblastoma protein (RB) phosphorylation in vitro. On the other hand, RAGE overexpression promoted migration, invasion, and mesenchymal features of lung adenocarcinoma cells through ERK signaling. Furthermore, an in vivo xenograft experiment indicated that RAGE promoted the metastasis of lung cancer cells with p21CIP1 up-regulation, ERK activation, and the changes of EMT markers. Regarding to the involvement of tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) in the microenvironment, we monitored the expressions of TAM markers including CD68 and CD163 as well as angiogenesis marker CD31 in xenograft slice. The data showed that RAGE might induce the accumulation of TAM in lung cancer cells and further accelerate the in vivo tumor growth. In summary, our study provides evidence indicating the distinct in vitro and in vivo effects of RAGE and related mechanisms on tumor growth and metastasis, which shed light on the oncogenic role of RAGE in lung cancer."

2,"Myofibroblasts derived type V collagen promoting tissue mechanical stress and facilitating metastasis and therapy resistance of lung adenocarcinoma cells. Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related mortality globally, with a dismal 5-year survival rate, particularly for Lung Adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Mechanical changes within the tumor microenvironment, such as extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and fibroblast activity, play pivotal roles in cancer progression and metastasis. However, the specific impact of the basement membrane (BM) on the mechanical characteristics of LUAD remains unclear. This study aims to identify BM genes influencing internal mechanical stress in tumors, elucidating their effects on LUAD metastasis and therapy resistance, and exploring strategies to counteract these effects. Using Matrigel overlay and Transwell assays, we found that mechanical stress, mimicked by matrix application, augmented LUAD cell migration and invasion, correlating with ECM alterations and activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway. Employing machine learning, we developed the SVM_Score model based on relevant BM genes, which accurately predicted LUAD patient prognosis and EMT propensity across multiple datasets. Lower SVM_Scores were associated with worse survival outcomes, elevated cancer-related pathways, increased Tumor Mutation Burden, and higher internal mechanical stress in LUAD tissues. Notably, the SVM_Score was closely linked to COL5A1 expression in myofibroblasts, a key marker of mechanical stress. High COL5A1 expression from myofibroblasts promoted tumor invasiveness and EMT pathway activation in LUAD cells. Additionally, treatment with Sorafenib, which targets COL5A1 secretion, attenuated the tumor-promoting effects of myofibroblast-derived COL5A1, inhibiting LUAD cell proliferation, migration, and enhancing chemosensitivity. In conclusion, this study elucidates the complex interplay between mechanical stress, ECM alterations, and LUAD progression. The SVM_Score emerges as a robust prognostic tool reflecting tumor mechanical characteristics, while Sorafenib intervention targeting COL5A1 secretion presents a promising therapeutic strategy to mitigate LUAD aggressiveness. These findings deepen our understanding of the biomechanical aspects of LUAD and offer insights for future research and clinical applications."

2,"The role of CEA, CYFRA21-1 and NSE in monitoring tumor response to Nivolumab in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients CEA, CYFRA21-1 and NSE are tumor markers used for monitoring the response to chemotherapy in advanced adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and small-cell lung cancer, respectively. Their role in cancer immunotherapy needs to be elucidated. Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were treated with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks within the Italian Nivolumab Expanded Access Program. Blood samples were collected at baseline, at each cycle up to cycle 5 and then every two cycles until patient’s withdrawn from the study. All patients underwent a CT-scan after every 4 cycles of treatment and responses were classified according to RECIST 1.1. The biomarkers serum levels were measured with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for CEA and with an immuno radiometric assay for CYFRA21-1 and NSE. The markers values at baseline and after 4 cycles were used to analyze the relationship between their variation over baseline and the tumor response, evaluated as disease control rate (DCR: CR + PR + SD), and survival (PFS and OS). A total of 70 patients were evaluable for the analysis. Overall, a disease control was obtained in 24 patients (35.8%, 4 PR + 20 SD). After 4 cycles of nivolumab a CEA or CYFRA21-1 reduction ≥ 20% over the baseline was significantly associated with DCR (CEA, p = 0.021; CYFRA21-1, p < 0.001), PFS (CEA, p = 0.028; CYFRA21-1, p < 0.001) and OS (CEA, p = 0.026; CYFRA21-1, p = 0.019). Multivariate analysis confirmed the ability of CYFRA21-1 reduction ≥ 20% to predict DCR (p = 0.002) and PFS (p < 0.001). The reduction in serum level of CYFRA21-1 or CEA might be a reliable biomarker to predict immunotherapy efficacy in NSCLC patients. NSE was not significant for monitoring the efficacy of nivolumab."
2,"Syntenin overexpression in human lung cancer tissue and serum is associated with poor prognosis Lung cancer is the major malignant tumour. The present study was conducted to determine the expression level of syntenin in lung cancer tissues and serum from lung cancer patients and to explore its clinical significance. Syntenin expression levels were determined in paraffin-embedded lung cancer tissue specimens (n = 191) using immunohistochemistry. The mRNA expressions of syntenin in fresh lung cancer tissues and the paracancerous tissues were examined by RT-qPCR (n = 25). Syntenin and VEGF expression levels were measured in serum from patients with lung cancer (n = 60) and control subjects (n = 30) using ELISA. The associations between syntenin and the clinicopathological features or prognosis in 191 patients with lung cancer were analysed. The correlation between the syntenin and VEGF levels in serum from 60 lung cancer patients was analysed. The expression levels of syntenin were significantly higher in lung cancer tissues than in paracancerous tissues based on immunohistochemistry and RT-qPCR, and elevated syntenin expression was significantly associated with tumour size (P = 0.002), TNM stage (P = 0.020), tumour distant metastasis (P = 0.033), overall survival (OS) (P = 0.002) and progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that increased expression of syntenin was an independent risk factor for OS (P = 0.006) and PFS (P < 0.001) in lung cancer patients. The expression levels of syntenin and VEGF in serum from lung cancer patients were higher than those from control subjects (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively), and their expression levels were positively correlated (r = 0.49, P < 0.001). Syntenin expression is upregulated in lung cancer patients, and its serum expression level is positively correlated with VEGF. Moreover, syntenin overexpression was correlated with poor prognosis in patients with lung cancer."

2,"Gender disparities in lung cancer incidence in the United States during 2001-2019. Lung cancer ranks as one of the top malignancies and the leading cause of cancer death in both males and females in the US. Using a cancer database covering the entire population, this study was to determine the gender disparities in lung cancer incidence during 2001-2019. Cancer patients were obtained from the National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. The SEER*Stat software was applied to calculate the age-adjusted incidence rates (AAIR). Temporal changes in lung cancer incidence were analyzed by the Joinpoint software. A total of 4,086,432 patients (53.3% of males) were diagnosed with lung cancer. Among them, 52.1% were 70 years or older, 82.7% non-Hispanic white, 39.7% from the South, and 72.6% non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The AAIR of lung cancer continuously reduced from 91.0 per 100000 to 59.2 in males during the study period, while it increased from 55.0 in 2001 to 56.8 in 2006 in females, then decreased to 48.1 in 2019. The female to male incidence rate ratio of lung cancer continuously increased from 2001 to 2019. Gender disparities were observed among age groups, races, and histological types. In those aged 0-54 years, females had higher overall incidence rates of lung cancer than males in recent years, which was observed in all races (except non-Hispanic black), all regions, and adenocarcinoma and small cell (but not squamous cell). Non-Hispanic black females aged 0-54 years had a faster decline rate than males since 2013. API females demonstrated an increased trend during the study period. Lung cancer incidence continues to decrease with gender disparities among age groups, races, regions, and histological types. Continuous anti-smoking programs plus reduction of related risk factors are necessary to lower lung cancer incidence further."
2,"Survival rates of cancer patients with and without rheumatic disease: a retrospective cohort analysis. To compare the outcomes of gastric, colon, lung, and breast cancer patients with and without rheumatic diseases (RD). This retrospective study compared the cancer survival rates of a cohort of 122 cancer patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), dermatomyositis/polymyositis (DM/PM), or systemic sclerosis with that of a cohort of 366 age-, sex-, and, cancer type-matched patients without RD who received medical care from 2000 to 2014. Staging, comorbidities, and functional status were ascertained. Survival was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. Relative risk of death was estimated as a hazard ratio (HR) using Cox regression analysis. The mean age of the RD patients at the time of cancer diagnosis was 58.7 ± 11.5 years. The overall survival rate of gastric cancer patients did not differ between the cohorts. The survival of lung or breast cancer was worse in patients with RA or DM/PM than in those without RD (all, p < 0.05). After adjusting for cancer stage, comorbidity index, performance status and age at the time of cancer diagnosis (as well as interstitial lung disease for lung cancer group), the mortality rate among lung cancer patients with RA was significantly higher (HR, 1.81; 95 % CI, 1.03–3.18) than that of lung cancer patients without RD, whereas SSc was associated with decreased mortality of lung cancer (HR, 0.16; 95 % CI, 0.04–0.58). DM/PM were associated with increased mortality of breast cancer patients (HR, 297.39; 95 % CI, 4.24–20842.33). RA and DM/PM seemed to be associated with a higher mortality in patients with lung or breast cancers, whereas SSc seemed to be associated with decreased mortality in patients with lung cancer. It is warranted to explore the survival effect of tailored cancer treatments according to specific RD."

2,"Forecasting lung cancer incidence, mortality, and prevalence to year 2030. Background Lung cancer incidence and prevalence is increasing worldwide and there is a focus on prevention, early detection, and development of new treatments which will impact the epidemiological patterns of lung cancer. The clinical characteristics and the trends in incidence, mortality, and prevalence of lung cancer in Denmark from 2006 through 2015 are described and a model for predicting the future epidemiological profile of lung cancer through 2030 is introduced. Methods The study population comprised all cases of lung cancer, registered in the Danish Cancer Registry, who were alive on January 1, 2006 or had a first-time ever diagnosis of lung cancer during 2006 through 2015. Information on morphology, stage of the disease, comorbidity and survival was obtained from other Danish health registers. Based on NORDCAN data and estimated patient mortality rates as well as prevalence proportions for the period 2006 through 2015, future case numbers of annual incidence, deaths, and resulting prevalence were projected. Results A total of 44.291 patients were included in the study. A shift towards more patients diagnosed with lower stages and with adenocarcinoma was observed. The incidence increased and the patient mortality rate decreased significantly, with a doubling of the prevalence during the observation period. We project that the numbers of prevalent cases of lung cancer in Denmark most likely will increase from about 10,000 at the end of 2015 to about 23,000 at the end of 2030. Conclusions Our findings support that lung cancer is being diagnosed at an earlier stage, that incidence will stop increasing, that mortality will decrease further, and that the prevalence will continue to increase substantially. Projections of cancer incidence, mortality, and prevalence are important for planning health services and should be updated at regular intervals."

2,"Activity of vitamin A analogues in cell cultures of mouse epidermis and organ cultures of hamster trachea. FIFTY years after the discovery that vitamin A controls cel differentiation in epithelial tissues the mechanism involved is still unknown. The recent introduction of two-cell and organ culture systems, involving serum-free medium, for the assay of vitamin A activity in vitro may help. One assay uses epidermal cell cultures derived from mouse skin1 and the other uses tracheal organ cultures from vitamin A-deficient hamsters2. In both, the observed cellular response depends on the addition of vitamin A, which induces a marked increase in the cellular RNA of the skin cultures and a change from the production of keratin to the production of cilia and mucus in the tracheal organ cultures. We have now investigated the Biological activity of seven analogues of natural vitamin A ester (β-retinyl acetate) and vitamin A acid (β-retinoic acid), in line with the common practice of assaying physiological and pharmacological actions of vitamins, hormones and drugs using structural analogues of a parent compound. In the analogues we used, the 5,6-cyclohexenyl ring system of natural vitamin A is modified substantially. Although data obtained in vivo show that modification of the ring portion of the molecule can reduce growth-promoting activity3–5, we found that several vitamin A analogues with alterations in the ring, including a shift of the 5,6-double bond of the cyclohexene ring to the 4,5-position and replacement of the cyclohexene ring with substituted aromatic and cyclopentene rings, have substantial activity in the skin and tracheobronchial assays. Because of the sensitivity of the two assays it is now possible to assay vitamin A activity in the 10−9–10−10M range (30–300 pg ml−1). Moreover, there is excellent correlation between the results of the two assays in terms of the evaluation of Biol.ogical activity of new analogues."
2,"Interleukin-1β-mediated suppression of microRNA-101 and upregulation of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 is involved in particle-induced lung cancer Lung cancer may be a result of complex factors. Small mineral particle is the well-known inducer of lung cancer. Previous study revealed the high morbidity of lung cancer in Xuan Wei in China, and the main cause of lung cancer is the use of smoky coal there. And it is generally accepted that chronic inflammation induced by small mineral particle may be a cause of lung cancer. But the relationship between chronic lung inflammation and lung cancer is largely unknown. In the present study, we found that silica particle was able to induce the secretion of interleukin-1β from a Xuan Wei lung cancer cell line, XWLC-05. At the same time, microRNA-101 (mir-101) was found to be downregulated by the treatment of silica particle. Interestingly, the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist and interleukin-1β antibody can reduce silica particle-induced downregulation of mir-101. Twenty-four Xuan Wei lung tumor tissues were collected to detect the expression level of mir-101 and enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which is the potential target of mir-101. The results showed that mir-101 was down-regulated and EZH2 were upregulated. Subsequently, the roles of mir-101 and EZH2 in tumor growth and progression in vitro were tested. Overexpression of mir-101 mimics was able to suppress the expression of EZH2 in XWLC-05 cells. And this resulted in the inhibited tumor cell growth and attenuated cell migration. The results in the present study showed that particle can induce the secretion of interleukin-1β. Interleukin-1β subsequently induces the downregulation of mir-101, which may result in the upregulated level of EZH2, and occurrence of lung cancer. We for the first time proposed the role interleukin-1β-mir-101-EZH2 axes in the particle-induced lung cancer. Further study may be needed to decipher the detailed mechanism involved."
2,"Increased lung cancer risks are similar whether arsenic is ingested or inhaled In 1980, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) determined there was sufficient evidence to support that inorganic arsenic was a human lung carcinogen based on studies involving exposure through inhalation. In 2004, IARC listed arsenic in drinking water as a cause of lung cancer, making arsenic the first substance established to cause human cancer through two unrelated pathways of exposure. It may initially seem counterintuitive that arsenic in drinking water would cause human lung cancer, and even if it did, one might expect risks to be orders of magnitude lower than those from direct inhalation into the lungs. In this paper, we consider lung cancer dose-response relationships for inhalation and ingestion of arsenic by focusing on two key studies, a cohort mortality study in the United States involving Tacoma smelter workers inhaling arsenic, and a lung cancer case-control study involving ingestion of arsenic in drinking water in northern Chile. When exposure was assessed based on the absorbed dose identified by concentrations of arsenic in urine, there was very little difference in the dose-response findings for lung cancer relative risks between inhalation and ingestion. The lung cancer mortality rate ratio estimate was 8.0 (95% CI 3.2-16.5, P<0.001) for an average urine concentration of 1179 microg/l after inhalation, and the odds ratio estimate of the lung cancer incidence rate ratio was 7.1 (95% CI 3.4-14.8, P<0.001) for an estimated average urine concentration of 825 microg/l following ingestion. The slopes of the linear dose-response relationships between excess relative risk (RR-1) for lung cancer and urinary arsenic concentration were similar for the two routes of exposure. We conclude that lung cancer risks probably depend on absorbed dose, and not on whether inorganic arsenic is ingested or inhaled."
2,"Why and how would we implement a lung cancer screening program For decades, lung cancer has been the most common cancer in terms of both incidence and mortality. There has been very little improvement in the prognosis of lung cancer. Early treatment following early diagnosis is considered to have potential for development. The National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), a large, well-designed randomized controlled trial, evaluated low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) as a screening tool for lung cancer. Compared with chest X-ray, annual LDCT screening reduced death from lung cancer and overall mortality by 20 and 6.7 %, respectively, in high-risk people aged 55–74 years. Several smaller trials of LDCT screening are under way, but none are sufficiently powered to detect a 20 % reduction in lung cancer death. Thus, it is very unlikely that the NLST results will be replicated. In addition, the NLST raises several issues related to screening, such as the high false-positive rate, overdiagnosis and cost. Healthcare providers and systems are now left with the question of whether the available findings should be translated into practice. We present the main reasons for implementing lung cancer screening in high-risk adults and discuss the main issues related to lung cancer screening. We stress the importance of eligibility criteria, smoking cessation programs, primary care physicians, and informed-decision making should lung cancer screening be implemented. Seven years ago, we were waiting for the results of trials. Such evidence is now available. Similar to almost all other cancer screens, uncertainties exist and persist even after recent scientific efforts and data. We believe that by staying within the characteristics of the original trial and appropriately sharing the evidence as well as the uncertainties, it is reasonable to implement a LDCT lung cancer screening program for smokers and former smokers."

2,"Epidemiological study on the relationship between the environmental pollution and lung cancer in high lung cancer incidence areas, China Xuanwei and Fuyuan, two counties located in southwest China, are areas with exceptionally high lung cancer incidence since the 1970s. In this study, questionnaires from a total of 18 communes, and 28 administrative villages (consisting of 280 small villages) in the two counties were fulfilled and collected. The sampling sites were randomly chosen in consideration of the incidence rate of lung cancer and the types of coal used. The sampling sites were divided into high lung cancer occurrence areas and low lung cancer occurrence areas. Industrial and environmental information was investigated and finally analyzed for the possible relationship to the lung cancer. It indicated that 78.1 % of the villages in high lung cancer incidence areas had been found using smoky coal or coking coals in people’s everyday lives; 43.4 % of these villages located near the coking factories, 31.1 % near the iron-zinc smelters and 11.8 % near the chemical industries. In the low lung cancer incidence areas, 78.8 % of the villages had been found using non-smoky coals (anthracite) in people’s everyday lives; 26.9 % of these villages are near the coking factories, 23.1 % near the iron-zinc smelters and 5.8 % near the chemical industries. Logistic regression analysis indicated that the coal type used was a foremost risk factor related to incidence of lung cancer [β > 0, Exp (β) >1, P < 0.05]. The use of smoky coals and coking coals seemed to be a hazardous factor for lung cancer generation, while non-smoky coals seemed to have no significant relationship to the lung cancer incidence. The results in this study added basic and important data and should be helpful for the future study on the etiology of lung cancer."
2,"MET amplification identified by next-generation sequencing and its clinical relevance for MET inhibitors. BACKGROUND MET amplification plays an important role in the development of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) either de novo or in resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) settings. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is the standard method for MET amplification. With more and more discoveries of oncogenic driver genes, next-generation sequencing (NGS) plays a significant role in precision oncology. Meanwhile, the role of NGS in MET amplification remains uncertain. METHODS Forty patients diagnosed with advanced NSCLC were included. FISH and NGS were conducted prior to MET inhibitors treatment. MET amplification by FISH was defined as a MET/CEP7 ratio of  >  2.0 and/or copy number (CN)  >  5. MET amplification by NGS was defined as gene copy number (GCN)  ≥  5. RESULTS The concordance rate among FISH and NGS was 62.5% (25/40). MET amplification identified by FISH showed the optimal predictive value. The partial response (PR) rate was 68.0% (17/25 with MET amplification) vs. 6.7% (1/15 without MET amplification); the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 5.4 months versus 1.0 months (P  < 0.001). MET amplification identified by NGS failed to distinguish significant clinical outcomes. The PR rate was 60.0% (6/10, with MET GCN  ≥ 5) vs. 40.0% (12/30, with MET GCN  < 5); the median PFS was 4.8 months vs. 2.2 months (P  = 0.357). The PR rate was 68.8% (11/16) and the median PFS was 4.8 months in patients with focal amplification by NGS. CONCLUSIONS MET amplification identified by FISH remains the optimal biomarker to identify suitable candidates for MET-TKI therapy. In comparison, amplification identified by NGS seems not as robust to be effective predictive biomarker. Further exploration is needed regarding the focal amplification by NGS in predicting the efficacy."
2,"Dose-dependent M2 macrophage polarization induced by Talaromyces marneffei promotes lung cancer cell growth via arginine-ornithine-cycle activation. It is now widely accepted that lungs are colonized by diverse microbes. Dysbiosis of the lung microbiota has been found to affect the progression of lung cancer. Fungi are a major component of the lung microbiota. However, the causal links between the mycobiome or specific species and lung cancer remain unclear. To address this, we conducted a study examining the composition of lung mycobiota in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) patients using shotgun metagenomics. The differential taxa between NSCLC patients and non-cancer controls were defined by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Nested PCR was used to measure the abundance of specific fungal species. Metabolomics analysis was performed to investigate the metabolic reprogramming of macrophages triggered by intracellular infection of specific fungal species. In vitro and in vivo assays were conducted to examine the effect of the specific fungus on cancer cell growth. Our findings showed that Ascomycota, Microsporidia and Mucoromycota were the dominant fungal taxa in the lungs. Talaromyces marneffei (T.marneffei) was the most significantly differential fungus between lung cancer patients and non-cancer controls, with its abundance positively correlated with lung cancer. The lung cancer animal model demonstrated that T.marneffei promotes lung cancer growth. Our study also demonstrated that T.marneffei promotes lung cancer cell growth by inducing dose-dependent M2 macrophage polarization through arginine-ornithine-cycle activation. Furthermore, inhibition of arginase can reduce M2 polarization of macrophages and the survival of T. marneffei inside macrophages. In summary, our study reveals that the increased abundance of T. marneffei in the lungs affects lung cancer cell growth by triggering arginine-induced M2 polarization of macrophages. These findings provide potential drug targets for the development of therapies aimed at targeting the survival of fungi inside macrophages in the fight against cancer."

2,"Incidence and risk of lung cancer in HIV-infected patients. Lung cancer is one of the most common non-AIDS-defining malignancies among HIV-infected patients. The incidence of lung cancer has significantly increased in the HIV-positive population in recent years. The purpose of this study was to summarize the incidence and risk of lung cancer in published population-based studies of people with HIV/AIDS. Published literature from PubMed, Embase, the Web of Science, and Google Scholar was retrieved. Sixty-five publications were selected and assessed for the following parameters: research coverage and location; continent; study period; duration of follow-up; lung cancer cases; HIV cases; incidence rate; and overall SIR or adjusted IRR. In addition, the risk of lung cancer was compared based on age, gender, HIV exposure category, CD4 count, and periods with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Lung cancer risk was greater among HIV-infected individuals compared with the general population. SIRs or adjusted IRRs were 1.5–3.4 in Europe, 0.7–6.9 in the USA, and 5.0 in Africa. Most, but not all studies did not observe a significant change in the incidence and risk of lung cancer between the pre-HAART and HAART eras. In most studies, the risk of lung cancer was higher among women, younger individuals, and injection drug users (IDUs), but the incidence of lung cancer was higher among men and the elderly. No significant trend in lung cancer risk across CD4 cell count categories was reported among the selected articles. Our study suggests an increase in the incidence and risk of lung cancer in HIV/AIDS population is worldwide. The effect of HAART on the incidence and risk of lung cancer is in dispute. The risk of lung cancer based on gender differences, especially among females, as well as IDUs, requires further investigation."

2,"Lung cancer screening with MRI: Evaluation of MRI for lung cancer screening by comparison of LDCT- and MRI-derived Lung-RADS categories in the first two screening rounds To evaluate MRI for lung cancer screening comparing LDCT- and MRI-derived Lung-RADS categories in the first two screening rounds. 224 participants in a lung cancer screening study were examined with MRI and low-dose CT (LDCT). Acquired MRI sequences were T2, balanced, T1 and DWI. MRI was prospectively analysed regarding nodules. Minimum nodule size was 4 mm. Nodules were assigned a Lung-RADS score based on appearance and size at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months. MRI findings were correlated with LDCT. The early recall rate dropped from 13.8% at baseline to 1.9% in the second screening round with biopsy rates of 3.6% in the first round and 0.5% in the second round. Histology revealed lung cancer in 8/9 participants undergoing biopsy/surgery. All eight cancers were accurately depicted by MRI. The following categories were assigned on MRI (results of LDCT in parentheses): 4B/4X in 10 (10) cases, 4A in 16 (15) cases, 3 in 13 (12) cases, 2 in 77 (92) cases and 1 in 140 (126) cases. Lung-RADS scoring correlated significantly between MRI and CT. The score was overestimated by MRI in one case for category 4A, in two cases for category 3 and in five cases for category 2. MRI-based Lung-RADS score was underestimated for category 1 in 20 cases. Lung-RADS might be applied for lung cancer screening with MRI, since findings correlated with LDCT. Relevant findings with a Lung-RADS score of 3 and higher were never missed or underestimated by MRI • MRI performed comparably to low-dose CT in a lung cancer-screening programme.;  • Lung-RADS might be applied for lung cancer screening with MRI.;  • Lung-RADS findings score of 3 and higher were never missed by MRI."
2,"Could serum Raftlin and GPER-1levels be new biomarkers for early detection of non-small cell lung cancer? <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Therefore, the search for new biomarkers continues in order to diagnose lung cancer at an early stage. In this study, we investigated blood levels of G-protein associated membrane estrogen receptor (GPER)-1 and Raftlin as markers of early-stage in lung cancer.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Lung cancer cases admitted to our hospital between 2016 and 2018 were included in our study. GPER-1 and Raftlin levels were measured by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) in blood samples taken from patients diagnosed with lung cancer and healthy volunteers.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">There were 64 cases in total, 32 cases in lung cancer group and 32 cases in control group. We evluated GPER-1 levels for each group. GPER-1 level was 2.54 (IQR: 1.08-5.78) ng/mL in the lung cancer group and 5 (IQR: 2.69-7.99) ng/mL in the control group. ROC analysis value for GPER-1, (AUC) was 0.66 (p &lt; 0.01). Raftlin levels were 4.5 (IQR: 3.3-11.52) ng/mL in control group and 7.77 (IQR: 6.24-9.85) ng/mL in lung cancer group. ROC analysis value for Raftlin, (AUC) was 0.629(P = 0.09).</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">In our study, there was no statistically significant difference between our groups in terms of Raftlin values. Therefore, it was thought that Raftlin could not be a specific marker in the diagnosis of lung cancer. GPER-1 was found to be lower in the lung cancer group than in healthy individuals. Therefore, it was thought that GPER-1 could be evaluated as a diagnostic marker in lung cancer. However, we think that more definitive results can be obtained by determining the tissue and expression level of GPER in lung cancer with further studies.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2024.

2,"Variation in Adequate Lymph Node Yield for Gastric, Lung, and Bladder Cancer: Attributable to the Surgeon, Pathologist, or Hospital? The Commission on Cancer recently released quality-of-care measures regarding adequate lymphadenectomy for colon, gastric, lung, and bladder cancer. There is currently little information regarding variation in adequate lymph node yield (ALNY) for gastric, lung, and bladder cancer. The New York State Cancer Registry and Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System were queried for stage I–III gastric, stage I–II lung, and stage II–III bladder cancer resections from 2004 to 2014. Hierarchical models assessed factors associated with ALNY (gastric ≥ 15; lung ≥ 10; bladder ≥ 2). Additionally, the proportions of variation attributable to surgeons, pathologists, and hospitals were estimated among Medicare patients. Among 3716 gastric, 18,328 lung, and 1512 bladder cancer resections, there were low rates of ALNY (gastric = 53%, lung = 36%, bladder = 67%). When comparing 2004–2006 and 2012–2014, there was significant improvement in ALNY for gastric cancer (39% vs. 68%), but more modest improvement for lung (33% vs. 38%) and bladder (65% vs. 71%) cancer. Large provider-level variation existed for each organ system. After controlling for patient-level factors/variation, the majority of variation was attributable to hospitals (gastric: surgeon = 4%, pathologist = 2.8%, hospital = 40%; lung: surgeon = 13.8%, pathologist = 1.5%, hospital = 18.3%) for gastric and lung cancer. For bladder cancer, most of the variation was attributable to pathologists (surgeon = 3.3%, pathologist = 10.5%, hospital = 6.2%). ALNY rates are low for gastric, lung, and bladder cancer, with only modest improvement over time for lung and bladder cancer. Given that the proportion of variation attributable to the surgeon, pathologist, and hospital is different for each organ system, future quality improvement initiatives should target the underlying causes, which vary by individual organ system."
2,"A systematic review of the impact of stigma and nihilism on lung cancer outcomes This study systematically reviewed the evidence on the influence of stigma and nihilism on lung cancer patterns of care; patients’ psychosocial and quality of life (QOL) outcomes; and how this may link to public health programs. Medline, EMBASE, ProQuest, CINAHL, PsycINFO databases were searched. Inclusion criteria were: included lung cancer patients and/or partners or caregivers and/or health professionals (either at least 80% of participants had lung cancer or were partners or caregivers of lung cancer patients, or there was a lung cancer specific sub-group focus or analysis), assessed stigma or nihilism with respect to lung cancer and published in English between 1st January 1999 and 31st January 2011. Trial quality and levels of evidence were assessed. Eighteen articles describing 15 studies met inclusion criteria. The seven qualitative studies were high quality with regard to data collection, analysis and reporting; however most lacked a clear theoretical framework; did not address interviewer bias; or provide a rationale for sample size. The eight quantitative studies were generally of low quality with highly selected samples, non-comparable groups and low participation rates and employed divergent theoretical and measurement approaches. Stigma about lung cancer was reported by patients and health professionals and was related to poorer QOL and higher psychological distress in patients. Clear empirical explorations of nihilism were not evident. There is qualitative evidence that from the patients’ perspectives public health programs contribute to stigma about lung cancer and this was supported by published commentary. Health-related stigma presents as a part of the lung cancer experience however there are clear limitations in the research to date. Future longitudinal and multi-level research is needed and this should be more clearly linked to relevant theory."
2,"Genetic polymorphism of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism and the risk of lung cancer. Chronic inhalation of cigarette smoke is a major risk factor for the development of lung cancer. It has been suggested that genetic susceptibility may contribute to the risk, because only a small portion of smokers develops the disease. Several polymorphisms that involve the metabolic activation or detoxification of carcinogens derived from cigarette smoke have been found to be associated with lung cancer risk. Many studies have focused on the relation between the distribution of polymorphic variants of different forms of the metabolic enzymes and lung cancer susceptibility. In this respect two groups of genetic polymorphisms of enzymes involved in xenobiotic metabolism, cytochrome P450 (CYP) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), have been discussed.CYP multigene superfamily consists of 10 subfamilies (CYP1-CYP10). A positive association between development of lung cancer and the mutant homozygous genotype ofCYP1A1 gene has been reported in several Japanese populations but such an association has not been observed in either Caucasians or African-Americans. The relation betweenCYP2D6 and lung cancer remains conflicting and inconclusive. Several polymorphisms have been identified at theCYP2E1 locus. No definitive link between the polymorphisms ofCYP2E1 and the risk of lung cancer has, however, been identified. The role of otherCYP2 isoforms in lung carcinogenesis has not been sufficiently investigated.GSTs form a superfamily of genes consisting of five distinct families, namedGSTA, GSTM, GSTP, GSTT andGSTS. The role ofGSTM, GSTT1 orGSTP1 polymorphism in modifying the lung cancer risk may be more limited than has been so far anticipated. Although some genetic polymorphisms discussed here have not shown significant increases/decreases in risk, individuals with differing genotypes may have different susceptibilities to lung cancer. Hopefully, in future studies it will be possible to screen for lung cancer using specific biomarkers."
2,"ZAR1 is a novel epigenetically inactivated tumour suppressor in lung cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths with 1.8 million new cases each year and poor 5-year prognosis. Promoter hypermethylation of tumour suppressors leads to their inactivation and thereby can promote cancer development and progression. In this study, we analysed ZAR1 (zygote arrest 1), which has been said to be a maternal-effect gene and its expression mostly limited to certain reproductive tissues. Our study shows that ZAR1 is expressed in normal lung but inactivated by promoter methylation in lung cancer. ZAR1 is hypermethylated in primary lung cancer samples (22% small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and 76% non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), p < 0.001) vs. normal control lung tissue (11%). In lung cancer cell lines, ZAR1 was significantly methylated in 75% of SCLC and 83% of NSCLC vs. normal tissue (p < 0.005/0.05). In matching tumours and control tissues, we observed that NSCLC primary tumour samples exhibited a tumour-specific promoter methylation of ZAR1 in comparison to the normal control lung tissue. Demethylation treatment of various lung cancer cell lines reversed ZAR1 promoter hypermethylation and subsequently re-established ZAR1 expression. In addition, we could show the growth inhibitory potential of ZAR1 in lung cancer cell lines and cancer cell lines. Exogenous expression of ZAR1 not only inhibited colony formation but also blocked cell cycle progression of cancer cell lines. Our study shows for the first time the lung tumour-specific epigenetic inactivation of ZAR1 due to DNA methylation of its CpG island promoter. Furthermore, ZAR1 was characterised by the ability to block tumour growth through the inhibition of cell cycle progression in cancer cell lines. We propose that ZAR1 could serve as an epigenetically inactivated biomarker in lung cancer."
2,"Heterogeneity of multiorgan metastases of human lung cancer cells genetically engineered to produce cytokines and reversal using chimeric monoclonal antibodies in natural killer cell-depleted severe combined immunodeficient mice. Lung cancer is a major cause of cancer deaths, most of which can be attributed to distant multiorgan metastases. To examine the cellular and molecular mechanisms of lung cancer metastasis to distant organs, we have established novel models of human lung cancer (small cell and non-small cell lung cancer) metastasis in natural killer cell-depleted severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. We investigated whether local production of the cytokines responsible for regulation of macrophage function at tumor growth sites affects the pattern of lung cancer metastasis in distant organs. Several lung cancer cell lines were genetically engineered to produce human macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and their metastatic potentials were assessed. Interestingly, M-CSF gene transduction had an antimetastatic effect for the liver and lymph nodes, but not the kidneys. In contrast, MCP-1 gene-modified lung cancer cells and their parent cells had identical metastatic potentials. These findings indicate a possible role for cyotokines and suggest that lung cancer has metastatic heterogeneity. Examining ways of controlling human lung cancer metastases, we investigated the antimetastatic effect of chimeric monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against P-glycoprotein and ganglioside GM2 (MH162 and KM966, respectively). Both MAbs, when given on days 2 and 7, inhibited the development of distant metastases of lung cancer in a dose-dependent fashion. Combined use of anti-P-glycoprotein MAb with M-CSF or MCP-1 gene transduction caused complete inhibition of metastasis of H69/VP cells. The antimetastatic effect of these MAbs in vivo was mainly due to an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity reaction mediated by mouse macrophages. These findings suggest that the mouse-human chimeric MAb in combination with cytokine gene transduction may be useful for the eradication of lung cancer metastases in humans."
2,"Arachidonic acid suppresses lung cancer cell growth and modulates lipid metabolism and the ERK/PPARγ signaling pathway. Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, necessitating the development of new treatment strategies. Arachidonic acid (ARA), a polyunsaturated fatty acid, shows promise in cancer therapy due to its potential anti-tumor effects, although its role in lung cancer remains unclear. This study investigated the effects and underlying mechanism of ARA on A549 and NCI-H1299 lung cancer cells. In vitro assays were used to assess cell viability, apoptosis, colony formation, lipid droplet formation, and changes in cellular lipid content. ARA dose-dependently suppressed cell viability, facilitated apoptosis, and suppressed colony formation in both lung cancer cell lines. Network pharmacology analysis was performed to identify potential gene targets and pathways, uncovering 61 overlapping genes between ARA and lung cancer-related targets, with mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) emerging as a key gene. Enrichment analyses suggested that the effects of ARA might be mediated through lipid metabolism and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) signaling pathway. In both lung cancer cell lines, ARA treatment inhibited lipid droplet formation and decreased the cellular lipids. Immunoblotting further confirmed that ARA treatment significantly increased ERK phosphorylation while reducing PPARγ and fatty acid synthase (FASN) protein levels. In vitro experiments using GW9662, a PPARγ antagonist, confirmed that inhibiting lipid droplet formation impairs lung cancer cell viability and promotes apoptosis. Furthermore, in vivo experiments demonstrated that ARA significantly reduced tumor size and weight in a lung cancer xenograft model, further validating its anti-tumor effects. The potential of ARA as a therapeutic agent for lung cancer might involve lipid metabolism and relevant signaling pathways. A future study exploring the full therapeutic potential of ARA and underlying mechanisms in lung cancer is needed."
2,"p53 protein, EGF receptor, and anti-p53 antibodies in serum from patients with occupationally derived lung cancer. The oncogene product epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R), the tumour suppressor gene product p53 and anti-p53 antibodies are detectable in the serum of certain cancer patients. Increased levels of some of these products were reported in lung cancer patients after occupational asbestos exposure and after exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or vinylchloride. In the first step, this study investigated the possible diagnostic value of serum EGF-R, p53-protein and anti-p53 antibodies, measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, in lung tumour patients. In addition to being investigated on a molecular epidemiological basis, these parameters were examined as biomarkers of carcinogenesis, especially with regard to asbestos incorporation effects or of radon-induced lung cancers. Also, a possible effect of cigarette smoking and age dependence were studied. A total of 116 male patients with lung or pleural tumours were examined. The histological classification was four small-cell cancers, six large-cell cancers, 32 adenocarcinomas, 47 squamous carcinomas, 12 mixed lung carcinomas, five diffuse malignant mesotheliomas and ten lung metastasis of extrapulmonary tumours. Twenty-two lung cancers and all mesotheliomas were related to asbestos, 22 lung cancers were related to ionizing radiation and 61 patients had cigarette smoke-related lung cancer. Besides these patients 50 male patients with non-malignant lung or pleural diseases were included; of the latter eight subjects suffered from asbestosis. Controls were 129 male subjects without any lung disease. No significantly elevated or decreased serum values for p53 protein, EGF-R, or anti-p53 antibodies as a function of histological tumour type, age, or degree and type of exposure (asbestos, smoking, ionizing radiation) could be found. The utility of p53-protein, EGF-R and anti-p53 antibodies as routine biomarkers for screening occupationally derived lung cancers is limited."
2,"Salvage treatment with irinotecan/cisplatin versus pemetrexed/cisplatin in patients with non-small cell lung cancer pre-treated with a non-platinum-based regimen in the first-line setting: a randomized phase II study of the Hellenic Oncology Research Group (HORG) Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard front-line treatment for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, non-platinum combinations of third-generation chemotherapeutic agents are considered an alternative therapeutic option for patients who cannot tolerate the toxic effects of platinum compounds. In this study, the efficacy and toxicity of the combination of irinotecan plus cisplatin (IC) was compared to pemetrexed plus cisplatin (PC) regimen, in platinum-naive patients with advanced NSCLC, who had been previously treated with the combination of a taxane plus gemcitabine. A total of 124 patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC were randomly assigned to either irinotecan 110 mg/m2 on day 1 and 100 mg/m2 on day 8 plus cisplatin 80 mg/m2 on day 8 every 3 weeks (IC arm) or pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 plus cisplatin 80 mg/m2 on day 1 every 3 weeks (PC arm). The primary endpoint of the study was the overall response rate (ORR). The ORR and median progression-free survival (PFS) in the IC arm were 18 % and 3.3 months, respectively, while in the PC arm were 19 % and 4.2 months (p = ns). Median overall survival (OS) was significantly higher in patients with PC (6.9 vs. 10.9; p = 0.013). PC regimen had a better toxicity profile compared to IC, with a statistically significant lower incidence of grade 3/4 neutropenia (3 vs. 31 %; p = 0.0001) and diarrhea (1.6 vs. 14.7 %, p = 0.018). In patients with advanced NSCLC pretreated with docetaxel/gemcitabine, the combination of pemetrexed/cisplatin is associated with increased OS and is better tolerated than the combination of irinotecan/cisplatin and should be considered as a valid therapeutic option for platinum-naive, previously treated patients.

2,"Multi-cohort analysis identifies a blood-based immune transcriptomic signature for early lung cancer detection. Early diagnosis of lung cancer is critical for timely intervention and reducing mortality. The immune system and cancer are intricately linked, which provides a unique opportunity to monitor changes in the immune system as a biomarker of cancer development. We collected bulk blood transcriptome from 432 lung cancer cases, 8154 healthy controls, and 14,187 samples with other diseases from 241 datasets for discovery. We also obtained a prospectively enrolled cohort of 371 subjects (172 with lung cancer) and 454 subjects from the Framingham Heart Study (42 with lung cancer) for validation. Furthermore, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing profiles of 1,022,063 cells from 260 blood, lymph node, or lung tissue samples from lung cancer patients and other samples across 15 datasets. We performed a multi-cohort blood transcriptome meta-analysis and identified 6 genes consistently differentially expressed between lung cancer and other samples. Using the 6-gene signature, we defined a lung cancer score that was primarily derived from myeloid cells and was consistently higher in tumor-associated macrophages and fibroblasts than their normal counterparts. In the prospectively enrolled cohort, the diagnostic classifier using the lung cancer score had an AUROC of 0.822 (95% CI: 0.78-0.864) for distinguishing patients with lung cancer from control or benign samples. The classifiers could also potentially reduce the need for additional testing in 37% of patients with benign lung conditions at 90% sensitivity. Importantly, the lung cancer score was also significantly associated with an elevated risk of future lung cancer diagnosis in the Framingham cohort study. Together, we identified a robust blood-based immune gene signature for early detection of lung cancer, which has potential for further clinical development to aid early cancer detection and diagnosis."
2,"Erratum to: PNA clamping-assisted fluorescence melting curve analysis for detecting EGFR and KRAS mutations in the circulating tumor DNA of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is emerging as a surrogate sample type for mutation analyses. To improve the clinical utility of cfDNA, we developed a sensitive peptide nucleic acid (PNA)-based method for analyzing EGFR and KRAS mutations in the plasma cfDNA of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Baseline tissue and plasma samples were collected from treatment-naive advanced NSCLC patients participated in a randomized phase II study, which was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov at Feb. 2009 (NCT01003964). EGFR and KRAS mutations in the plasma cfDNA were analyzed retrospectively using a PNA clamping-assisted fluorescence melting curve analysis. The results were compared with those obtained from tissue analysis performed using the direct sequencing. Exploratory analyses were performed to determine survival predicted by the plasma and tissue mutation status. Mutation analyses in matched tissue and plasma samples were available for 194 patients for EGFR and 135 patients for KRAS. The mutation concordance rates were 82.0 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 76.5–87.4) for EGFR and 85.9 % (95 % CI, 80.1–91.8) for KRAS. The plasma EGFR mutation test sensitivity and specificity were 66.7 % (95 % CI, 60.0–73.3) and 87.4 % (95 % CI, 82.7–92.1), respectively, and the plasma KRAS mutation test sensitivity and specificity were 50.0 % (95 % CI, 41.6–58.4) and 89.4 % (95 % CI, 84.2–94.6), respectively. The predictive value of the plasma EGFR and KRAS mutation status with respect to survival was comparable with that of the tissue mutation status. These data suggest that plasma EGFR and KRAS mutations can be analyzed using PNA-based real-time PCR methods and used as an alternative to tumor genotyping for NSCLC patients when tumor tissue is not available."
2,"Basigin-2 upregulated by receptor activator of NF-κB ligand enhances lung cancer-induced osteolytic lesions. Lung cancer bone metastasis causes poor prognosis. Basigin-2, a novel cancer-associated biomarker, is upregulated in lung cancer and has been linked with tumor progression. But little is known about the role of basigin-2 in lung cancer bone metastasis and osteolytic lesion. Basigin-2 expression was evaluated in biopsy tissue specimens of 20 lung cancer patients with bone metastases via immunohistochemistry. Invasion assay and MTT proliferation assay were performed to test the invasion and proliferation of lung cancer cell after modulated basigin-2 expression. The osteoclastic activity of basigin-2 was detected in tibia cancer model by injected of lung cancer cells. The regulation role of receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) on basigin-2 and its downstream molecules were measured by real-time quantitative RT-PCR, gelatin zymography and western blot analysis. We found that basigin-2 was highly expressed in lung cancer bone metastases. Then, we demonstrated that basigin-2 could promote lung cancer cells invasion, metastasis and proliferation through upregulating metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2), MMP-9 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. The lung cancer cells overexpressing basigin-2 strongly induced the osteolytic lesions in immunodeficient mice, which were reduced by treatment with basigin-2 blocking antibody. Furthermore, we explored the enhanced basigin-2 molecular mechanism in lung cancer bone metastasis. Our results indicated the RANKL, pivotal for the control of bone resorption, could increase basigin-2 and its downstream molecules MMP-2, MMP-9 and VEGF expression in vitro. Basigin-2 upregulated by RANKL induces MMPs and VEGF, which may increase lung cancer cell metastasis ability and support osteoclastic activity. Thus, our data suggest important roles for basigin-2 in lung cancer-induced osteolytic lesion and implicate this protein potential application as a target for lung cancer bone metastasis therapy."
2,"Characteristics of lung cancer among patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and interstitial lung disease - analysis of institutional and population data. Lung Cancer is occasionally observed in patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). We sought to describe the epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of lung cancer for patients with IPF and other interstitial lung disease (ILD) using institutional and statewide data registries. We conducted a retrospective analysis of IPF and non-IPF ILD patients from the ILD center registry, to compare with lung cancer registries at the University of Pittsburgh as well as with population data of lung cancer obtained from Pennsylvania Department of Health between 2000 and 2015. Among 1108 IPF patients, 31 patients were identified with IPF and lung cancer. The age-adjusted standard incidence ratio of lung cancer was 3.34 (with IPF) and 2.3 (with non-IPF ILD) (between-group Hazard ratio = 1.4, p = 0.3). Lung cancer worsened the mortality of IPF (p <  0.001). Lung cancer with IPF had higher mortality compared to lung cancer in non-IPF ILD (Hazard ratio = 6.2, p = 0.001). Lung cancer among IPF was characterized by a predilection for lower lobes (63% vs. 26% in non-IPF lung cancer, p <  0.001) and by squamous cell histology (41% vs. 29%, p = 0.07). Increased incidence of lung cancer was observed among single lung transplant (SLT) recipients for IPF (13 out of 97, 13.4%), with increased mortality compared to SLT for IPF without lung cancer (p = 0.028) during observational period. Lung cancer is approximately 3.34 times more frequently diagnosed in IPF patients compared to general population, and associated with worse prognosis compared with IPF without lung cancer, with squamous cell carcinoma and lower lobe predilection. The causality between non-smoking IPF patients and lung cancer is to be determined."
2,"Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screening identifies ITGA8 responsible for abivertinib sensitivity in lung adenocarcinoma. The emergence of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) has improved the prognosis for lung cancer patients with EGFR-driven mutations. However, acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs poses a significant challenge to the treatment. Overcoming the resistance has primarily focused on developing next-generation targeted therapies based on the molecular mechanisms of resistance or inhibiting the activation of bypass pathways to suppress or reverse the resistance. In this study we developed a novel approach by using CRISPR-Cas9 whole-genome library screening to identify the genes that enhance the sensitivity of lung adenocarcinoma cells to EGFR-TKIs. Through this screening, we revealed integrin subunit alpha 8 (ITGA8) as the key gene that enhanced sensitivity to abivertinib in lung adenocarcinoma. Notably, ITGA8 expression was significantly downregulated in lung adenocarcinoma tissues compared to adjacent normal tissues. Bioinformatics analyses revealed that ITGA8 was positively correlated with the sensitivity of lung adenocarcinoma to abivertinib. We showed that knockdown of ITGA8 significantly enhanced the proliferation, migration and invasion of H1975 cells. Conversely, overexpression of ITGA8 reduced the proliferation migration and invasion of H1975/ABIR cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ITGA8 sensitized lung adenocarcinoma cells to EGFR-TKIs by attenuating the downstream FAK/SRC/AKT/MAPK signaling pathway. In H1975 cell xenograft mouse models, knockdown of ITGA8 significantly increased tumor growth and reduced the sensitivity to abivertinib, whereas overexpression of ITGA8 markedly suppressed tumor proliferation and enhanced sensitivity to the drug. This study demonstrates that ITGA8 inhibits the proliferation, invasion and migration of lung adenocarcinoma cells, enhances the sensitivity to EGFR-TKIs, improves treatment efficacy, and delays the progression of acquired resistance. Thus, ITGA8 presents a potential therapeutic candidate for addressing acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs from a novel perspective."
2,"Angiomotin-p130 inhibits vasculogenic mimicry formation of small cell lung cancer independently of Smad2/3 signal pathway. Lung cancer, the most concerning malignancy worldwide and one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths. Growing evidence indicates that Angiomotin (Amot)-p130 plays an important role in types of cancer, including breast cancer and gastric cancer. Moreover, evidence suggested that the low Amot-p130 expression correlates with the poor prognosis of lung cancer patients, however, the role and mechanism of Amot-p130 in lung cancer is still unclear. In this study, we showed that Amot-p130 expression was reduced in lung cancer tissues, compared with the adjacent para-carcinoma tissues. In addition, we observed that the reduced expression of Amot-p130 was associated with vasculogenic mimicry (VM) channels formation in lung cancer tissues. Amot-p130 expression was differently expression in lung cancer cell line H446, H1688 and H2227 compared with the normal human lung cells HFL1. To clarify the role of Amot-p130 in lung cancer, we constructed the Amot-p130 expressing H446 cells and Amot-p130 silencing H1299 cells. We confirmed that Amot-p130 overexpression inhibited the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells, whereas its silence promoted cell migration and invasion. Interestingly, we also found that Amot-p130 overexpression suppressed VM tube formation in H446 cells, while its knockdown promoted VM tube formation in H2227 cells. Further studies suggested that Amot-p130 plays roles in M tube formation of lung cancer cell V are independent on smad2/3 signaling pathway. Finally, inoculation of Amot-p130 expressing H446 cells and Amot-p130 silencing H1299 cells into nude mice suppressed tumor growth, when compared with the control group. Based on these results, Amot-p130 serves as a possible diagnostic and therapeutic target in lung cancer patients, and may be an effective mediator of VM formation in lung cancer."
2,"The Effect of Artificial Neural Network Model Combined with Six Tumor Markers in Auxiliary Diagnosis of Lung Cancer To evaluate the diagnosis potential of artificial neural network (ANN) model combined with six tumor markers in auxiliary diagnosis of lung cancer, to differentiate lung cancer from lung benign disease, normal control, and gastrointestinal cancers. Serum carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), gastrin, neurone specific enolase (NSE), sialic acid (SA), Cu/Zn, Ca were measured through different experimental procedures in 117 lung cancer patients, 93 lung benign disease patients, 111 normal control, 47 gastric cancer patients, 50 patients with colon cancer and 50 esophagus cancer patients, 19 parameters of basic information were surveyed among lung cancer, lung benign disease and normal control, then developed and evaluated ANN models to distinguish lung cancer. Using the ANN model with the six serum tumor markers and 19 parameters to distinguish lung cancer from benign lung disease and healthy people, the sensitivity was 98.3%, the specificity was 99.5% and the accuracy was 96.9%. Another three ANN models with the six serum tumor markers were employed to differentiate lung cancer from three gastrointestinal cancers, the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of distinguishing lung cancer from gastric cancer by the ANN model of lung cancer-gastric cancer were 100%, 83.3% and 93.5%, respectively; The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of discriminating lung cancer by lung cancer-colon cancer ANN model were 90.0%, 90.0%, and 90.0%; And which were 86.7%, 84.6%, and 86.0%, respectively, by lung cancer-esophagus cancer ANN model. ANN model built with the six serum tumor markers could distinguish lung cancer, not only from lung benign disease and normal people, but also from three common gastrointestinal cancers. And our evidence indicates the ANN model maybe is an excellent and intelligent system to discriminate lung cancer."
2,"Targetable ""driver"" mutations in non small cell lung cancer. Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the world despite advances in the field of cancer therapeutics. Traditional treatment with empirically chosen cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, have given small, but real survival benefits. Recent advances and insights into molecular pathogenesis of lung cancers have provided some novel molecular targets, offering newer strategies and agents that are tumor specific. Studies have identified mutations in specific genes that are involved in driving the development of lung cancer and so it is important to subsequently target them with specific drugs thus changing paradigms of management of this type of cancer. Recently, Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium (LCMC) has identified at least one of the many recognized “driver mutations” in nearly two thirds of the patients with advanced cancer. This study suggests that identification of driver mutations can help in molecular targeted therapeutics and in addition supplant tumor histology in guiding treatment decisions, identifying subset of patients who may benefit therapy. This review focuses on these mutations identified in specific genes serving as “drivers” of lung tumorigenesis and suggests that clear promise for the future of lung cancer treatment is indeed personalized therapy with drugs chosen according to the patient mutation profile. Most clinically relevant translational advances made in genes involved in lung tumorigenesis namely EML4-ALK fusions, HER2, PIK3CA, AKT, BRAF, MAP2K1, MET mutations and amplifications along with the well established EGFR and KRAS mutations are discussed in the context of NSCLCs. These studies emphasize the need for treatment management based on mutation profile along with routine histology based classification of these tumors in future for a directed therapy and thus a better therapeutic outcome."
2,"Histological classification and TNM staging of lung cancer BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of lung cancer comprises a variety of different histological types and clinical situations. METHODS: Review of the recent literature. RESULTS: Generally, primary lung carcinomas are classified according to the best differentiated component following WHO criteria and are graded according to the worst differentiated component. Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) are all those lung carcinomas without evidence of small cell lung cancer. Depending on tumour size, more than 50% of lung carcinomas contain more than one of the histological types of the main representatives of NSCLC. However, minor portions are not included in the classification. Main representatives, with a prevalence of more than 90%, are squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma. About 80% of lung carcinomas are assigned to the group of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), 20% are small cell lung cancers (SCLC). Of NSCLC, the group of adenocarcinomas is steadily increasing and currently amounts to 40%, squamous cell carcinomas also amount to 40%, the rest are large cell carcinomas and other rare tumour types. The pathologist establishes the diagnosis of a clinically suspected malignant tumour from biopsy material, especially considering dignity, differentiation between primary lung carcinoma and metastasis, classification and tumour type with particularly meticulous differentiation between small cell carcinoma and NSCLC. Intraoperative frozen section directly determines further surgical procedure. Pathological examination of the resected specimen provides current pTNM classification and thereby determines further prognosis and therapy. The newly revised WHO histopathologic classification of lung cancer, international TNM Staging System for Lung Cancer as well as stage groupings are presented. CONCLUSIONS: Stage and histopathologic type determine appropriate treatment and prognosis of lung cancer."

2,"The risk of a second primary lung cancer after a first invasive breast cancer according to estrogen receptor status. Lung cancers account for 5 % of second primary cancers after breast cancer. The low overall 5-year relative survival rate of lung cancer makes it a particularly concerning new malignancy for breast cancer survivors. It is unknown whether second lung cancer risk varies by estrogen receptor (ER) expression of the first breast cancer. We evaluated second primary lung cancer risks using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) (95 % confidence intervals (CIs)) among 222,148 one-year breast cancer survivors in the NCI-SEER Program registry database (1992–2008). Relative risks (RRs) and 95 % CIs for lung cancer following ER− compared with ER+ breast cancer were estimated using Poisson regression, adjusted for age, year, and stage of breast cancer diagnosis, attained age, latency, and radiotherapy. We also examined the reciprocal association of second ER− and ER+ breast cancers among 28,107 1-year lung cancer survivors. There were 418 and 1,444 second lung cancers diagnosed following 50,781 ER− and 171,367 ER+ breast cancers. Second lung cancer rates were significantly elevated after ER− (SIR = 1.20 (1.09–1.33)), but not ER+ (SIR = 0.96 (0.91–1.01)) breast cancer. The adjusted RR for a second lung cancer following ER− compared with ER+ breast cancer was 1.22 (1.10–1.37). The reciprocal adjusted RR for a second ER− compared with ER+ breast cancer following lung cancer was 1.29 (0.98–1.70). The parallel increase for a second lung cancer following an ER− first breast cancer and for a second ER− breast cancer after a first lung cancer suggests that there may be shared etiologic factors for these cancers. Further evaluation of lung cancer risk after ER− breast cancer may identify women at high risk for this fatal malignancy."

2,"Risk patterns of lung cancer mortality in northern Thailand. Over the past decade, lung cancers have exhibited a disproportionately high mortality and increasing mortality trend in Thailand, especially in the northern region, and prevention strategies have consequently become more important in this region. Spatial analysis studies may be helpful in guiding any strategy put in place to respond to the risk of lung cancer mortality in specific areas. The aim of our study was to identify risk patterns for lung cancer mortality within the northern region of Thailand. In the spatial analysis, the relative risk (RR) was used as a measure of the risk of lung cancer mortality in 81 districts of northern Thailand between 2008 and 2017. The RR was estimated according to the Besag-York-Mollie autoregressive spatial model performed using the OpenBUGS routine in the R statistical software package. We presented the overall and gender specific lung cancer mortality risk patterns of the region using the Quantum Geographic Information System. The overall risk of lung cancer mortality was the highest in the west of northern Thailand, especially in the Hang Dong, Doi Lo, and San Pa Tong districts. For both genders, the risk patterns of lung cancer mortality indicated a high risk in the west of northern Thailand, with females being at a higher risk than males. There was distinct geographical variation in risk patterns of lung cancer mortality in Thailand. Differences could be related to differences in risk factors such as ground-based radon and air pollution. This study provides a starting point for estimating the spatial pattern of the risk of lung cancer mortality and for examining associations between geographic risk factors and lung mortality for further studies."
2,"Lung cancer risk in germline p53 mutation carriers: association between an inherited cancer predisposition, cigarette smoking, and cancer risk We recently observed a significantly increased risk for lung cancer in carriers of p53 germline mutations. Because cigarette smoking is known to play an important role in increasing the risk for lung cancer in the general population, we wanted to determine the role of cigarette smoking in lung cancer risk in people with a genetic susceptibility based on a p53 germline mutation. We studied 1263 people from 97 families enrolled in a cohort study of families systematically ascertained through childhood soft-tissue sarcoma patients treated at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, University of Texas, between 1944 and 1975. We assessed the incidence of lung and smoking-related cancers in 33 carriers of germline p53 mutations and in 1,230 noncarriers to determine whether there was an association between an inherited cancer predisposition, cigarette smoking, and cancer risk. We analyzed the association between cigarette smoking, mutation status, and lung and other smoking-related cancers by the Kaplan-Meier method and the Cox proportional hazards model with adjustments for birth year, race, and sex. In the hazards model, we incorporated a robust variance estimation to adjust for familial correlation. We observed an increased risk of a variety of histological types of lung cancer in the carriers of the p53 germline mutation. Mutation carriers who smoked had a 3.16-fold (95% confidence interval =1.48-6.78) higher risk for lung cancer than the mutation carriers who did not smoke. Our results demonstrate that cigarette smoking significantly increases lung cancer risk in carriers of a germline p53 mutation. This finding could be useful in designing strategies for early detection and treatment of lung and smoking-related cancers in individuals with this inherited cancer predisposition."
2,"Oct4 promotes M2 macrophage polarization through upregulation of macrophage colony-stimulating factor in lung cancer Expression of Oct4 maintains cancer stem cell (CSC)-like properties in lung cancer cells and is correlated with poor prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. M2-type tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) promote cancer cell migration and metastasis. Tumor microenvironments promote monocyte differentiation into M2 TAMs via a complex cytokine-based connection. We explored the role of Oct4 in cytokine secretion in lung cancer and its impact on M2 TAM polarization. Monocytes co-cultured with the conditioned medium from Oct4-overexpressing lung cancer cells were used to investigate M2 TAM differentiation. The inflammatory factors in the conditioned medium of Oct4-overexpressing A549 cells were examined using human inflammation antibody arrays. The correlations of Oct4, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), and M2 TAMs were validated in lung cancer cells, syngeneic mouse lung tumor models, and clinical samples of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Oct4-overexpressing A549 cells expressed elevated levels of M-CSF, which contributed to increased M2 macrophages and enhanced tumor migration. Overexpression of Oct4 enhanced tumor growth and reduced the survival of lung tumor-bearing mice, which was correlated with increased number of M2 macrophages in lung cancer. Notably, NSCLC patients with high expression levels of Oct4, M-CSF, and M2 TAMs had the poorest recurrence-free survival. A positive correlation between Oct4, M-CSF, and M2 TAMs was observed in the tumor tissue of NSCLC patient. Treatment with all-trans retinoic acid exerted anti-tumor effects and reduced M2 TAMs in tumor-bearing mice. Our results indicate that Oct4 expressed by lung cancer cells promotes M2 macrophage polarization through upregulation of M-CSF secretion, leading to cancer growth and metastasis. Our findings also implicate that the Oct4/M-CSF axis in M2 macrophage polarization may be potential therapeutic targets for lung cancer."
2,"Local and systemic neutrophilic inflammation in patients with lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Recent investigations suggest that neutrophils play an important role in the immune response to lung cancer as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The aim of this study was to evaluate the amount of neutrophils and markers of their activity in lung cancer and COPD and in coexistence of these two diseases. In total, 267 persons were included in the study: 139 patients with lung cancer, 55 patients with lung cancer and COPD, 40 patients with COPD, and 33 healthy subjects. Peripheral blood and BAL fluid samples were obtained for cell count analysis and determination of NE, MPO levels and ROS production. NE and MPO levels in the serum and BAL fluid were determined by ELISA. ROS production was analyzed by flow cytometer. The percentage, cell count of neutrophils and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio in the peripheral blood were significantly higher in lung cancer patients with or without COPD compared to COPD patients or healthy individuals (P < 0.05). The percentage and cell count of neutrophils in BAL fluid were significantly lower in patients with lung cancer with or without COPD than in patients with COPD (P < 0.05). However, BAL fluid and serum levels of both NE and MPO were significantly higher in patients with lung cancer than COPD patients or healthy individuals (P < 0.05). Neutrophils produced higher amounts of ROS in patients with lung cancer with or without COPD compared with COPD patients or healthy individuals (P < 0.05). The results from this study demonstrate higher degree of local and systemic neutrophilic inflammation in patients with lung cancer (with or without COPD) than in patients with COPD."
2,"Association between environmental tobacco smoke exposure and lung cancer susceptibility: modification by antioxidant enzyme genetic polymorphisms. Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) is the primary etiologic factor responsible for lung cancer. However, only 10–15 % of smokers develop lung cancer, suggesting a genetic role in modifying individual susceptibility to lung cancer. Antioxidant enzymes and genetic polymorphisms should be considered. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of antioxidant enzyme activity and genetic polymorphisms in modifying the susceptibility to lung cancer among individuals exposed to ETS. A total of 150 male subjects were divided into three groups: 50 lung cancer patients, 50 chronic smokers, and 50 passive smokers. Genotyping of microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) exon 3 (Tyr113Hist) and exon 4 (Hist139Arg) polymorphisms were done by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. MnSOD (Val16Ala) polymorphism was detected by the real time-TaqMan assay. Erythrocyte MnSOD activity was measured spectrophotometrically. ETS-exposed individuals (both active and passive smokers) who carried the His allele of mEH exon3 have a 2.9-fold increased risk of lung cancer (odds ratio [OR] 2.9, P < 0.001). In addition, ETS-exposed carriers of the Arg allele of mEH exon 4 have a 2.1-fold increased risk of lung cancer (OR 2.1, P = 0.024). However, no association between the MnSOD Val16Ala polymorphism and lung cancer was detected among ETS-exposed individuals (OR 1.6, P = 0.147), although the lung cancer group had significantly lower MnSOD activity than the chronic or passive smoker groups (P = 0.03). Exons 3 and 4 polymorphisms of the mEH gene may contribute to lung cancer susceptibility through disturbed antioxidant balance. However, this was not the case with the MnSOD Val16Ala single-nucleotid polymorphism. Antioxidant enzymes may modulate the influence of ETS exposure on lung cancer risk."
2,"Emodin regulated lactate metabolism by inhibiting MCT1 to delay non-small cell lung cancer progression. Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world, with high incidence rate and mortality. Monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 1 has been found to be widely expressed in various tumors and plays a crucial role in regulating energy metabolism. Emodin, as an important traditional Chinese medicine in China, has been reported to inhibit the progression of lung cancer. However, its potential mechanism has not been fully elucidated. The effects of emodin and MCT1 inhibitor AZD3965 on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung cancer cells were detected using cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, wound-healing assay, and transwell small chamber assay. The content of glucose, lactate, and pyruvate in the cell culture medium was detected using a glucose, lactate, and pyruvate detection kit, and also detected protein expression using western blotting. In addition, to investigate the effects of emodin and AZD3965 on lung cancer in vivo, we constructed nude mice subcutaneous transplant tumor model by subcutaneous injection of lung cancer cells. The results showed that emodin and AZD3965 could inhibit the proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung cancer cells. At the same time, they could inhibit the expression of MCT1 in lung cancer cells and promote the release of lactate, but did not affect the content of glucose and pyruvate. In vivo experiments had shown that emodin and AZD3965 could effectively inhibit the growth of lung cancer and inhibit the expression of MCT1. All in all, our data suggested that emodin inhibited the proliferation, migration, and invasion of lung cancer cells, possibly by inhibiting MCT1, providing important theoretical basis for elucidating the mechanism of emodin in treating lung cancer."
2,"Relationship between lung function and lung cancer risk: a pooled analysis of cohorts plus Mendelian randomization study. Since little consensus has been reached on whether milder reduction in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) increases lung cancer incidence, we conducted a meta-analysis and performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis to explore the association and causal relationship between FEV1 and lung cancer incidence. We conducted a comprehensive search from PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases as of February 2020. MR analysis was performed using summary data obtained from two large consortia [International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO) and Neale Lab] to assess the possible causality between FEV1 and lung cancer risk. Eight studies involving 88,743 cases were included. The incidence of lung cancer increased with decreasing FEV1.The combined odds ratio (OR) of decreased FEV1 for lung cancer incidence was 1.91 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.67–2.19; P   100% of predicted), the OR was 3.06 (95% CI 2.20–4.24; P < 0.001) for quintile 1 (< 70% of predicted), 1.89 (95% CI 1.50–2.38; P < 0.001) for quintile 2 (70–80% of predicted), 1.53 (95% CI 1.31–1.79; P < 0.001) for quintile 3 (80–90% of predicted), and 1.64 (95% CI 1.18–2.28; P = 0.003) for quintile 4 (90–100% of predicted). In subgroup meta-analysis, the correlation between FEV1 and lung cancer risk was different among men (OR = 1.74; 95% CI 1.49–2.03; P < 0.001) and women (OR = 2.80; 95% CI 1.87–4.19; P < 0.001). However, MR analysis showed no causality between the FEV1 and lung cancer risk (OR = 1.199; 95% CI 0.958–1.500; P = 0.114). FEV1 is likely to be a predictor of lung cancer, especially for women. However, genetically decreased FEV1 is not causally correlated with lung cancer incidence."
2,"Twenty-eight-day mortality in lung cancer patients with metastasis who initiated mechanical ventilation in the emergency department. Few data are available regarding treatment outcomes in lung cancer patients with metastasis who initiated mechanical ventilation in the emergency department (ED). We aimed to evaluate 28-day mortality in lung cancer patients with metastasis who initiated mechanical ventilation in the ED. Patients with solid malignancy who initiated mechanical ventilation in the ED of a tertiary hospital were retrospectively identified and stratified into four groups according to the presence of lung cancer and metastasis. Among 212 included patients, the mortality rates by the 28th hospital day were as follows: 44.2% (19/43) in non-lung cancer patients without metastasis, 63.2% (43/68) in non-lung cancer patients with metastasis, 52.4% (11/21) in lung cancer patients without metastasis, and 66.2% (53/80) in lung cancer patients with metastasis. In multivariable analysis, lung cancer patients with metastasis had significantly higher odds ratio for 28-day mortality than non-lung cancer patients without metastasis (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 7.17, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.14–24.01). Sepsis-related respiratory failure (adjusted OR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.16–5.84) and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (adjusted OR = 13.34, 95% CI = 4.45–39.95) over respiratory failure without sepsis and acute organ dysfunction process measured by sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (adjusted OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.05–12.6) were independently associated with an increase in mortality rate. In conclusion, the treatment outcomes in lung cancer patients with metastasis who initiated mechanical ventilation in the ED were poor. Aggressive resuscitation versus end-of-life care in advance of an unexpected medical crisis should be considered in lung cancer patients with metastasis via a multidisciplinary approach with a consideration of underlying comorbid illnesses in the acute organ dysfunction processes."
2,"Lung cancer risk and cancer-specific mortality in subjects undergoing routine imaging test when stratified with and without identified lung nodule on imaging study To assess the risk of lung cancer and specific mortality rate in patients with and without solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) on chest radiograph and CT. This prospective study included 16,078 patients ≥35 years old (893 of them had an SPN detected with either chest radiograph or CT) and 15,185 without SPN. Patients were followed up for 18 months or until being diagnosed with lung cancer. Risk and mortality lung cancer were calculated in both groups with Poisson regression. In patients with SPN, incidence of lung cancer was 8.3 % (95 % CI 6.0–11.2) on radiograph and 12.4 % (95 % CI 9.3–15.9) on CT. A chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in patients with radiographs (odds ratio 2.62; 95 % CI 1.03, 6.67) and smoking habit (odds ratio 20.63; 95 % CI 3.84, 110.77) in patients with CT were associated with a higher probability of lung cancer. Large nodule size and spiculated edge were associated with lung cancer on both CT and radiograph. Lung cancer-specific mortality was lower in patients with SPN than in those without SPN (1.73/1000 person-years, 95 % CI 1.08–2.88 vs. 2.15/1000 person-years, 95 % CI 1.25–3.96). The risk of lung cancer for patients with SPN is higher in clinical populations than in screening studies. Moreover, patients with SPN showed lower mortality than those without SPN. • Lung cancer risk is 8 % for SPN detected on routine radiographs.;  • Lung cancer risk is 12.4 % for SPN detected in routine chest CT.;  • Smoking, COPD, SPN diameter and edge were predictors of malignancy.;  • Lung cancer risk of SPN in routine practice seems higher than in screening."
2,"Lung Cancer Stem Cells and Implications for Future Therapeutics Lung cancer is the most dreaded of all cancers because of the higher mortality rates associated with it worldwide. The various subtypes of lung cancer respond differently to a particular treatment regime, which makes the therapeutic interventions all the more complicated. The concept of cancer stem cells (CSCs) is based primarily on the clinical and experimental observations that indicate the existence of a subpopulation of cells with the capacity to self-renew and differentiate as well as show increased resistance to radiation and chemotherapy. They are considered as the factors responsible for the cases of tumor relapse. The CSCs may have significant role in the development of lung tumorigenesis based on the identification of the CSCs which respond during injury. The properties of multi-potency and self-renewal are shared in common by the lung CSCs with the normal pluripotent stem cells which can be isolated using the similar markers. This review deals with the origin and characteristics of the lung cancer stem cells. The role of different markers used to isolate lung CSCs like CD44, ALDH (aldehyde dehydrogenase), CD133 and ABCG2 (ATP binding cassette sub family G member 2) have been discussed in detail. Analysis of the developmental signaling pathways such as Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, hedgehog in the regulation and maintenance of the lung CSCs have been done. Finally, before targeting the lung CSC biomarkers for potential therapeutics, challenges faced in lung cancer stem cell research need to be taken into account. With the accepted notion that the CSCs are to blame for cancer relapse and drug resistance, targeting them can be an important aspect of lung cancer therapy in the future."

2,"Quality of life during clinical trials: conceptual model for the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) To appreciate the full benefits of treatment for lung cancer, especially in trials that fail to show improvements in survival, data recording the quality of life must be captured and refined to produce meaningful information. A conceptual model for quality of life for lung cancer patients was tested to obtain information about the dimensions of the quality-of-life construct for ongoing development and testing of a subjective measure for clinical trials. Using a longitudinal study design, the stability of predictive factors of the physical and functional dimensions of quality of life were examined using regression analysis. A patient-rated quality-of-life measure, the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS), was administered to 144 non-smallcell lung cancer patients at baseline, day 29, and day 71 of a chemotherapy trial. The range of explained variance for all three components of the lung cancer model over three assessment points was as follows: symptomatic distress 41%–53%, activity status 48%–52%, and overall quality of life 35%–53%. The three dimensions fluctuated slightly during intervention, but were relatively stable factors across all three times of evaluation. The LCSS model explained nearly half of the variance for quality of life experienced by lung cancer patients during therapy with a new chemotherapeutic agent. These findings provide support that the physical and functional dimensions are important predictors of quality of life for individuals with lung cancer. Meaningful subjective quality-of-life data can be obtained to evaluate an intervention by using a disease-and sitespecific quality-of-life measure for individuals with lung cancer, based on a reproducible conceptual model such as the LCSS, which is suitable for serial measurement for the progressive disease of lung cancer."

2,"Erratum to: Estimation of minimally important differences in EQ-5D utility and VAS scores in cancer Background: Understanding what constitutes an important difference on a HRQL measure is critical to its interpretation. The aim of this study was to provide a range of estimates of minimally important differences (MIDs) in EQ-5D scores in cancer and to determine if estimates are comparable in lung cancer. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on cross-sectional data collected from 534 cancer patients, 50 of whom were lung cancer patients. A range of minimally important differences (MIDs) in EQ-5D index-based utility (UK and US) scores and VAS scores were estimated using both anchor-based and distribution-based (1/2 standard deviation and standard error of the measure) approaches. Groups were anchored using Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) ratings and FACT-G total score-based quintiles. Results: For UK-utility scores, MID estimates based on PS ranged from 0.10 to 0.12 both for all cancers and for lung cancer subgroup. Using FACT-G quintiles, MIDs were 0.09 to 0.10 for all cancers, and 0.07 to 0.08 for lung cancer. For US-utility scores, MIDs ranged from 0.07 to 0.09 grouped by PS for all cancers and for lung cancer; when based on FACT-G quintiles, MIDs were 0.06 to 0.07 in all cancers and 0.05 to 0.06 in lung cancer. MIDs for VAS scores were similar for lung and all cancers, ranging from 8 to 12 (PS) and 7 to 10 (FACT-G quintiles). Discussion: Important differences in EQ-5D utility and VAS scores were similar for all cancers and lung cancer, with the lower end of the range of estimates closer to the MID, i.e. 0.08 for UK-index scores, 0.06 for US-index scores, and 0.07 for VAS scores."
2,"Visual assessment of early emphysema and interstitial abnormalities on CT is useful in lung cancer risk analysis Screening for lung cancer should be limited to a high-risk-population, and abnormalities in low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening images may be relevant for predicting the risk of lung cancer. Our aims were to compare the occurrence of visually detected emphysema and interstitial abnormalities in subjects with and without lung cancer in a screening population of smokers. Low-dose chest CT examinations (baseline and latest possible) of 1990 participants from The Danish Lung Cancer Screening Trial were independently evaluated by two observers who scored emphysema and interstitial abnormalities. Emphysema (lung density) was also measured quantitatively. Emphysema was seen more frequently and its extent was greater among participants with lung cancer on baseline (odds ratio (OR), 1.8, p = 0.017 and p = 0.002) and late examinations (OR 2.6, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001). No significant difference was found using quantitative measurements. Interstitial abnormalities were more common findings among participants with lung cancer (OR 5.1, p < 0.001 and OR 4.5, p < 0.001).There was no association between presence of emphysema and presence of interstitial abnormalities (OR 0.75, p = 0.499). Even early signs of emphysema and interstitial abnormalities are associated with lung cancer. Quantitative measurements of emphysema—regardless of type—do not show the same association. • Visually detected emphysema on CT is more frequent in individuals who develop lung cancer. • Emphysema grading is higher in those who develop lung cancer. • Interstitial abnormalities, including discrete changes, are associated with lung cancer.;  • Quantitative lung density measurements are not useful in lung cancer risk prediction.;  • Early CT signs of emphysema and interstitial abnormalities can predict future risk."

2,"A Community-based Pulmonary Nodule Clinic: Improving Lung Cancer Stage at Diagnosis. Objective; ; Pulmonary nodules (PNs) are a common incidental finding and are often how lung cancer is discovered. Our goal was to determine if establishing a pulmonary nodule clinic (PNC) in a community healthcare setting would lead to an earlier stage at diagnosis.; ; Methods; ; A single healthcare system retrospective review was conducted of all PNC patients from 2010-2015 diagnosed with lung cancer. The stage at diagnosis was analyzed and compared to lung cancer patients in our healthcare system outside the PNC and to national data. Five-year survival rates for PNC patients from 2010-2012 were also analyzed.; ; Results; ;  A total of 119 patients and 127 lung cancers were diagnosed through the PNC from 2010-2015. There were 990 lung cancers, with a known stage, diagnosed outside the PNC in our healthcare system from 2010 to 2015. Two hundred and eighty one (28.4%) cancers were Stage I, compared to 69 (54.3%) (p <0.0001) through the PNC; 110 (11.1%) cancers were diagnosed at Stage II compared to 17 (13.4%) through the PNC (0.4471); 277 (25.7%) cancers were diagnosed at Stage III, compared to 21 (16.5%) through the PNC (p 0.0060); 598 (60.4%) cancers were diagnosed at Stage IV, compared to 20 (15.7%) through the PNC (p <0.0001). Five-year survival rates for patients diagnosed in 2010 were 80% (four of five patients), 79.2% (19/24) in 2011, and 62.2% (23/37) in 2012.; ; Conclusions; ;  Lung cancer survival is directly related to the stage at diagnosis. Establishment of our PNC has led to an earlier stage at diagnosis compared to the general lung cancer population in our community."
2,"Association of serum follistatin levels with histological types and progression of tumor in human lung cancer Follistatin (FST), an activin-binding protein, inhibits activin action by interfering with activin binding to its receptor. The prognostic value of FST has been studied in various cancers. However, these studies rarely focus on lung cancer. In our study, we investigated the relationship between serum FST levels and lung cancer with histologic types, TNM staging, and recurrence. A total of 150 serum samples were collected, including 91 from patients with SCLC or NSCLC, 22 from patients with benign lung diseases, and 37 from healthy subjects. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine serum FST levels in healthy subjects, patients with benign lung diseases and patients with lung cancers. Serum FST levels in patients with LADC, SCC, LASC, LCLC, and SCLC were much higher than those in healthy subjects and in patients with lung benign disease. A ROC curve was constructed for differentiating the lung cancer from the healthy subjects and benign lung diseases. The results indicated that the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.971 and 0.728 respectively. According to TNM staging, serum FST level increased significantly in patients with stage III and IV of LADC. Moreover, serum FST expression were increased in LADC patients with different TNM category. Furthermore, we found that a higher expression of serum FST was correlated with recurrence in LADC patients. The serum FST levels gradually increased with the rise of TNM staging and category in lung cancer patients. These data suggest that serum FST levels not only can be used in auxiliary diagnosis for lung cancer but also might be associated with the disease progression and metastasis of lung cancers."
2,"The preventive role of cardiorespiratory fitness in current male smokers who meet the American Cancer Society criteria for lung cancer screening: a prospective pilot study Survival benefits could be potentially improved by adding cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) to lung cancer screening. The current pilot study aimed to assess the association between CRF and adverse outcomes in current male smokers who are meeting the American Cancer Society (ACS) criteria for lung cancer screening. A total of 260 men with a baseline CRF assessment (treadmill exercise test) who are met the ACS lung cancer screening criteria (“current smokers aged 55–74 years with ≥ 30 pack/years smoking history”) were prospectively studied. Cox proportional hazard models were analyzed for all-cause and cancer mortality, total and lung cancer incidence. Mean age was 63.3 ± 5.4 years, smoking history 50.4 ± 26.7 pack/years, and CRF was 7.8 ± 3.2 metabolic equivalents (METs). During a mean of 10.2 ± 6.1 years follow-up, 80 participants developed any type of cancer, 19 were diagnosed with lung cancer and 66 died (cancer, n = 39, other causes, n = 27). In multivariable models, only CRF was associated with all-cause and cancer mortality. Each 1-MET higher CRF was associated with a 10% reduced risk for all-cause mortality [0.9, 95% CI (0.83 to 0.98), p = 0.017] and cancer mortality [0.9, 95% CI (0.8 to 0.99), p = 0.048]. CRF was not associated with total cancer incidence (p = 0.59) or lung cancer incidence (p = 0.96). Higher CRF is independently associated with lower risk of all-cause and cancer mortality in current male smokers who meet the ACS criteria for lung cancer screening. Screening for CRF and achieving higher CRF levels could potentially reduce mortality and serve as complementary preventive strategy in heavy smokers."
2,"Isothiocyanates induce oxidative stress and suppress the metastasis potential of human non-small cell lung cancer cells Isothiocyanates are natural compounds found in consumable cruciferous vegetables. They have been shown to inhibit chemical carcinogenesis by a wide variety of chemical carcinogens in animal models. Recent studies have also shown that isothiocyanates have antitumor activity, inhibiting the growth of several types of cultured human cancer cells. Our previous study showed that PEITC inhibited human leukemia cells growth by inducing apoptosis. However, the effect of isothiocyanates on lung cancer cell metastasis has not been studied. In the present study, we investigated the inhibitory effects of BITC and PEITC on metastatic potential of highly metastatic human lung cancer L9981 cells. Cell migration and invasion were measured by wound healing assay and transwell chemotaxis assay. Expression of metastasis-related genes was assessed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. The mechanisms of action were evaluated by flow cytometry, reporter assay and Western blotting. Our data showed that both BITC and PEITC inhibited L9981 cell growth in a dose-dependent manner, the IC50 values were 5.0 and 9.7 μM, respectively. Cell migrations were reduced to 8.1% and 16.5% of control, respectively; and cell invasions were reduced to 2.7% and 7.3% of control, respectively. Metastasis-related genes MMP-2, Twist and β-catenin were also modulated. BITC and PEITC inhibited cell survival signaling molecules Akt and NFκB activation. Moreover, BITC and PEITC increased ROS generation and caused GSH depletion. Pretreatment with NAC blocked BITC and PEITC induced ROS elevation and NFκB inhibition. Our results indicated that BITC and PEITC suppress lung cancer cell metastasis potential by modulation of metastasis-related gene expression, inhibition of Akt/NFκB pathway. Induction of oxidative stress may play an important role."

2,"Signaling pathways and clinical application of RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer An increasing number of studies have focused on the early diagnostic value of the methylation of RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer. However, the intricate cellular events related to RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer are still a mystery. For researchers and clinicians aiming to more profoundly understand the diagnostic value of methylated RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer, this review will provide deeper insights into the molecular events of RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer. We searched for relevant publications in the PubMed and Google Scholar databases using the keywords “RASSF1A”, “SHOX2” and “lung cancer” etc. First, we reviewed the RASSF1A and SHOX2 genes, from their family structures to the functions of their basic structural domains. Then we mainly focused on the roles of RASSF1A and SHOX2 in lung cancer, especially on their molecular events in recent decades. Finally, we compared the value of measuring RASSF1A and SHOX2 gene methylation with that of the common methods for the diagnosis of lung cancer patients. The RASSF1A and SHOX2 genes were confirmed to be regulators or effectors of multiple cancer signaling pathways, driving tumorigenesis and lung cancer progression. The detection of RASSF1A and SHOX2 gene methylation has higher sensitivity and specificity than other commonly used methods for diagnosing lung cancer, especially in the early stage. The RASSF1A and SHOX2 genes are critical for the processes of tumorigenesis, development, metastasis, drug resistance, and recurrence in lung cancer. The combined detection of RASSF1A and SHOX2 gene methylation was identified as an excellent method for the screening and surveillance of lung cancer that exhibits high sensitivity and specificity."
2,"Serum and blood based biomarkers for lung cancer screening: a systematic review. Lung cancer is the second most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer death for both men and women. Although low-dose CT (LDCT) is recommended for lung cancer screening in high-risk populations and may decrease lung cancer mortality, there is a need to improve the accuracy of lung cancer screening to decrease over-diagnosis and morbidity. Blood and serum-based biomarkers, including EarlyCDT-lung and microRNA based biomarkers, are promising adjuncts to LDCT in lung cancer screening. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of EarlyCDT-lung, micro-RNA signature classifier (MSC), and miR-test, and their impact on lung cancer-related mortality and all-cause mortality. References were identified using searches of PubMed, EMBASE, and Ovid Medline® from January 2000 to November 2015. Phase three or greater studies in the English language evaluating the diagnostic performance of EarlyCDT-lung, MSC, and miR-test were selected for inclusion. Three phase 3 studies were identified, one evaluating EarlyCDT-lung, one evaluating miR-Test, and one evaluating MSC respectively. No phase 4 or 5 studies were identified. All three biomarker assays show promise for the detection of lung cancer. MSC shows promise when used in conjunction with LDCT for lung cancer detection, achieving a positive likelihood ratio of 18.6 if both LDCT and MSC are positive, and a negative likelihood ratio of 0.03 if both LDCT and MSC are negative. However, there is a paucity of high-quality studies that can guide clinical implementation. There is currently no high quality evidence to support or guide the implementation of these biomarkers in clinical practice. Reports of further research at stages four and five for these, and other promising methods, is required."
2,"Metabolic shifts in lipid utilization and reciprocal interactions within the lung metastatic niche of triple-negative breast cancer revealed by spatial multi-omics. The Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) subtype constitutes 15-20% of breast cancer cases and is associated with the poorest clinical outcomes. Distant metastasis, particularly to the lungs, is a major contributor to the high mortality rates in breast cancer patients. Despite this, there has been a lack of comprehensive insights into the heterogeneity of metastatic tumors and their surrounding ecosystem in the lungs. In this study, we utilized spatial RNA sequencing technology to investigate the heterogeneity of lung metastatic tumors and their microenvironment in two spontaneous lung metastatic mouse models. Our findings revealed an increase in metabolic-related genes within the cancer cells, with the hub gene Dlat (Dihydrolipoamide S-Acetyltransferase) showing a significant association with the development of lung metastatic tumors. Upregulation of Dlat led to the reprogramming of fatty acid utilization, markedly enhancing the bioenergetic capacity of cancer cells. This finding was corroborated by the increased dependence on fatty acid utilization in lung metastatic cancer cells, and inhibition of Dlat in breast cancer cells exhibited a reduced oxygen consumption rate. Consequently, inhibition of Dlat resulted in decreased survival capacity of breast cancer by reducing cancer stem cell properties and cell adhesion in the lung in vivo. The three cell components within the lung metastatic niche, including CD163<sup>+</sup> macrophages, neutrophils, and endothelial cells, expressed elevated levels of ApoE, leading to the secretion of various protumorigenic molecules that promote cancer cell growth in the lung. These molecules include galectin-1, S100A10, S100A4, and S100A6. Collectively, our findings highlight the lipid metabolism reprogramming of cancer and components of the tumor microenvironment that support lung metastasis of TNBC breast cancer."
2,"Multi-window CT based Radiomic signatures in differentiating indolent versus aggressive lung cancers in the National Lung Screening Trial: a retrospective study We retrospectively evaluated the capability of radiomic features to predict tumor growth in lung cancer screening and compared the performance of multi-window radiomic features and single window radiomic features. One hundred fifty lung nodules among 114 screen-detected, incident lung cancer patients from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) were investigated. Volume double time (VDT) was calculated as the difference between continuous two scans and used to define indolent and aggressive lung cancers. Lung nodules were semi-automatically segmented using lung and mediastinal windows separately, and subtracting the mediastinal window region from the lung window region generated the difference region. 364 radiomic features were separately exacted from nodules using the lung window, the mediastinal window and the difference region. Multivariable models were conducted to identify the most predictive features in predicting tumor growth. Clinical information was also obtained from the database. Based on our definition, 26% of the cases were indolent lung cancer. The tumor growth pattern could be predicted by radiomic models constructed using features obtained in the lung window, the difference region, and by combining features obtained in both the lung window and difference regions with areas under the receiver operator characteristic (AUROCs) of 0.799, 0.819, and 0.846, respectively. The multi-window feature model showed better performance compared to single window features (P < 0.001). Incorporating clinical factors into the multi-window feature models showed improvement, yielding an accuracy of 84.67% and AUROC of 0.855 for distinguishing indolent from aggressive disease. Multi-window CT based radiomics features are valuable predictors of indolent lung cancers and out performed single CT window setting. Combining clinical information improved predicting performance."
2,"miRNAs as Biomarkers and Therapeutic Targets in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: Current Perspectives Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. Up to 85% of lung cancer cases are diagnosed as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The effectiveness of NSCLC treatment is expected to be improved through the implementation of robust and specific biomarkers. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding molecules that play a key role in the regulation of basic cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, by controlling gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Deregulation of miRNA activity results in the loss of homeostasis and the development of a number of pathologies, including lung cancer. During lung carcinogenesis, miRNAs exhibit dual regulatory function: they act as oncogenes to promote cancer development or as tumour suppressors. Unique miRNA sequences have been detected in malignant tissues and corresponding healthy tissues. Furthermore, stable forms of tumour-related miRNAs are detectable in the peripheral blood of patients with NSCLC. The potential benefits of using extracellular miRNAs present in body fluids as part of the diagnostic evaluation of cancer include low invasiveness (compared with tumour cell/tissue sampling), and the repeatability and ease of obtaining the specimens. Apart from the diagnostic applications of altered miRNA expression profiles, the dual regulatory role of miRNA in cancer might drive the further development of personalised therapies in NSCLC. The clinical usefulness of miRNA expression analysis to predict the efficacy of various treatment strategies including surgery, radio- and chemotherapy, and targeted therapies has been evaluated in NSCLC. Also, the capacity of a single miRNA to regulate the expression of multiple genes simultaneously presents an opportunity to use these small molecules in personalised therapy as individualised therapeutic tools."
2,"Body composition and lung cancer-associated cachexia in TRACERx. Cancer-associated cachexia (CAC) is a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in individuals with non-small cell lung cancer. Key features of CAC include alterations in body composition and body weight. Here, we explore the association between body composition and body weight with survival and delineate potential biological processes and mediators that contribute to the development of CAC. Computed tomography-based body composition analysis of 651 individuals in the TRACERx (TRAcking non-small cell lung Cancer Evolution through therapy (Rx)) study suggested that individuals in the bottom 20th percentile of the distribution of skeletal muscle or adipose tissue area at the time of lung cancer diagnosis, had significantly shorter lung cancer-specific survival and overall survival. This finding was validated in 420 individuals in the independent Boston Lung Cancer Study. Individuals classified as having developed CAC according to one or more features at relapse encompassing loss of adipose or muscle tissue, or body mass index-adjusted weight loss were found to have distinct tumor genomic and transcriptomic profiles compared with individuals who did not develop such features. Primary non-small cell lung cancers from individuals who developed CAC were characterized by enrichment of inflammatory signaling and epithelial-mesenchymal transitional pathways, and differentially expressed genes upregulated in these tumors included cancer-testis antigen MAGEA6 and matrix metalloproteinases, such as ADAMTS3. In an exploratory proteomic analysis of circulating putative mediators of cachexia performed in a subset of 110 individuals from TRACERx, a significant association between circulating GDF15 and loss of body weight, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue was identified at relapse, supporting the potential therapeutic relevance of targeting GDF15 in the management of CAC."
2,"Lung cancer referral patterns in the former Yorkshire region of the UK The purpose of this study was to find out what proportion of patients are referred as lung cancer guidelines assume, whether different referral pathways result in different management and what proportion of patients are seen within recommended time intervals between referral and treatment. A randomly selected sample of 400 lung cancer cases registered with the former Yorkshire Cancer Registry database in 1993 was selected for casenote analysis. Mode of presentation, speciality of initial referral, treatment by specialist, time intervals for key points in the referral pathways were analyzed. A total of 362 (90.5%) of case-notes were available. Less than half of lung cancer patients (173, 47.8%) presented to hospital with a chest X-ray diagnosis of lung cancer. Forty-one (11.3%) presented as self-referrals to Accident and Emergency and the remainder were referred without a diagnosis of lung cancer by other routes, mainly via GPs. Patients who did not present initially with a lung cancer diagnosis were less likely to receive specialist care (62%:96%), or have their diagnosis histologically confirmed (57.1%:80.3%) or receive surgery or radical radiotherapy (6.9%:13.9%). Nine per cent of all 362 patients did not receive a specialist opinion. Eighty per cent of patients referred by a GP with CXR suspected lung cancer were seen at hospital within 2 weeks. Only 32.4% of those receiving active treatment were treated within 8 weeks of clinical diagnosis or first hospital visit. Lung cancer patients presenting to hospital without a suspicious CXR are less likely to have specialist care, histological confirmation of their cancer and have lower rates of active treatment (surgery, any radiotherapy or chemotherapy)."
2,"Lipid alterations play a role in the integration of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and anlotinib for the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Studies have shown that integrating anlotinib with programmed death 1 (PD-1)/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors enhances survival rates among progressive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients lacking driver mutations. However, not all individuals experience clinical benefits from this therapy. As a result, it is critical to investigate the factors that contribute to the inconsistent response of patients. Recent investigations have emphasized the importance of lipid metabolic reprogramming in the development and progression of NSCLC.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">The objective of this investigation was to examine the correlation between lipid variations and observed treatment outcomes in advanced NSCLC patients who were administered PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors alongside anlotinib. A cohort composed of 30 individuals diagnosed with advanced NSCLC without any driver mutations was divided into three distinct groups based on the clinical response to the combination treatment, namely, a group exhibiting partial responses, a group manifesting progressive disease, and a group demonstrating stable disease. The lipid composition of patients in these groups was assessed both before and after treatment.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Significant differences in lipid composition among the three groups were observed. Further analysis revealed 19 differential lipids, including 2 phosphatidylglycerols and 17 phosphoinositides.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">This preliminary study aimed to explore the specific impact of anlotinib in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors on lipid metabolism in patients with advanced NSCLC. By investigating the effects of using both anlotinib and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, this study enhances our understanding of lipid metabolism in lung cancer treatment. The findings from this research provide valuable insights into potential therapeutic approaches and the identification of new therapeutic biomarkers.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2024.

2,"Index-based dietary patterns and risk of lung cancer in the NIH-AARP diet and health study. Dietary pattern analysis considers combinations of food intake and may offer a better measure to assess diet–cancer associations than examining individual foods or nutrients. Although tobacco exposure is the major risk factor for lung cancer, few studies have examined whether dietary patterns, based on preexisting dietary guidelines, influence lung cancer risk. After controlling for smoking, we examined associations between four diet quality indices—Healthy Eating Index–2010 (HEI-2010), Alternate Healthy Eating Index–2010 (AHEI-2010), alternate Mediterranean Diet score (aMED) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)—and lung cancer risk in the NIH–AARP (National Institutes of Health-American Association of Retired Persons) Diet and Health study. Baseline dietary intake was assessed in 460 770 participants. Over a median of 10.5 years of follow-up, 9272 incident lung cancer cases occurred. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and confidence intervals (CIs). Comparing highest to lowest quintiles, HRs (95% CIs) for lung cancer were as follows: HEI-2010=0.83 (0.77–0.89), AHEI-2010=0.86 (0.80–0.92), aMED=0.85 (0.79–0.91) and DASH=0.84 (0.78–0.90). Among the individual components of the dietary indices, higher consumption of whole grains and fruits was significantly inversely associated with lung cancer risk for several of the diet indices. Total index score analyses stratified by smoking status showed inverse associations with lung cancer for former smokers; however, only HEI-2010 was inversely associated in current smokers and no index score was inversely associated among never smokers. Although smoking is the factor most strongly associated with lung cancer, this study adds to a growing body of evidence that diet may have a modest role in reducing lung cancer risk, especially among former smokers."
2,"Potential Racial Disparities Using Current Lung Cancer Screening Guidelines. The current age threshold for lung cancer screening targets individuals beginning at age 55. These guidelines were developed based on results from the National Lung Cancer Screening Trial where only 4.4% of the enrollees were African American, when they represent 12.3% of US population. African Americans were also found to have higher incidence and younger onset of lung cancer. We hypothesized that implementation of screening at age 55 would not detect a substantial fraction of early onset lung cancer cases in African American population. We used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program data to determine the frequency of early-onset lung cancers and to assess the stage at diagnosis in a biracial sample. Microscopically confirmed lung cancer (primary site code C 34) cases were identified using SEER 18 registry (2004–2014). Early-onset cancers were defined as cancers diagnosed in persons aged 45 to 54 years. Cases were stratified by race and age groups. Comparisons were evaluated with chi-square tests. 468,403 lung cancers were diagnosed during this period. Nearly 9% of all lung cancers were early onset, with increased frequency in African Americans vs. Whites, 14.2 vs. 8.2%, p < 0.05. Age-adjusted incidence rates were significantly higher in African Americans with highest percent difference noted for age group 50–54. African Americans were more likely to be diagnosed at advanced stages of lung cancer compared to Whites. We conclude that the current age threshold for lung cancer screening may potentially miss a considerable number of lung cancer cases in African Americans. Further studies are needed to determine the appropriateness of screening age criteria for African Americans."
2,"KLF4 regulates adult lung tumor-initiating cells and represses K-Ras-mediated lung cancer Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in both men and women worldwide. To identify novel factors that contribute to lung cancer pathogenesis, we analyzed a lung cancer database from The Cancer Genome Atlas and found that Kruppel-like Factor 4 (KLF4) expression is significantly lower in patients' lung cancer tissue than in normal lung tissue. In addition, we identified seven missense mutations in the KLF4 gene. KLF4 is a transcription factor that regulates cell proliferation and differentiation as well as the self-renewal of stem cells. To understand the role of KLF4 in the lung, we generated a tamoxifen-induced Klf4 knockout mouse model. We found that KLF4 inhibits lung cancer cell growth and that depletion of Klf4 altered the differentiation pattern in the developing lung. To understand how KLF4 functions during lung tumorigenesis, we generated the K-ras(LSL-G12D/+);Klf4(fl/fl) mouse model, and we used adenovirus-expressed Cre to induce K-ras activation and Klf4 depletion in the lung. Although Klf4 deletion alone or K-ras mutation alone can trigger lung tumor formation, Klf4 deletion combined with K-ras mutation significantly enhanced lung tumor formation. We also found that Klf4 deletion in conjunction with K-ras activation caused lung inflammation. To understand the mechanism whereby KLF4 is regulated during lung tumorigenesis, we analyzed KLF4 promoter methylation and the profiles of epigenetic factors. We found that Class I histone deacetylases (HDACs) are overexpressed in lung cancer and that HDAC inhibitors induced expression of KLF4 and inhibited proliferation of lung cancer cells, suggesting that KLF4 is probably repressed by histone acetylation and that HDACs are valuable drug targets for lung cancer treatment."
2,"Preoperative AminoIndex Cancer Screening (AICS) abnormalities predict postoperative recurrence in patients undergoing curative resection for non-small cell lung cancer AminoIndex™ Cancer Screening (AICS (lung)) was developed as a screening test for lung cancer using a multivariate analysis of plasma-free amino acid (PFAA) profiles. According to the developed index composed of PFAA, the probability of lung cancer was categorized into AICS (lung) ranks A, B, and C in order of increasing risk. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between the preoperative AICS (lung) rank and surgical outcomes in patients who underwent curative resection for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Preoperative blood samples were collected from 297 patients who underwent curative resection for NSCLC between 2006 and 2015. PFAA concentrations were measured. The relationship between the preoperative AICS (lung) rank and clinicopathological factors was examined. The effects of the preoperative AICS (lung) rank on postoperative outcomes were also analyzed. The AICS (lung) rank was A in 93 patients (31.3%), B in 82 (27.6%), and C in 122 (41.1%). The AICS (lung) rank did not correlate with any clinicopathological factors, except for age. Based on follow-up data (median follow-up period of 6 years), postoperative recurrence was observed in 22 rank A patients (23.7%), 15 rank B (18.3%) and 49 rank C (40.2%). In the univariate analysis, preoperative AICS (lung) rank C was a worse factor of recurrence-free survival (p = 0.0002). The multivariate analysis identified preoperative AICS (lung) rank C (HR: 2.17, p = 0.0005) as a significant predictor of postoperative recurrence, particularly in patients with early-stage disease or adenocarcinoma. Preoperative AICS (lung) rank C is a high-risk predictor of postoperative recurrence in patients undergoing curative resection for NSCLC."

With respect to the overall patient cohort, osimertinib + chemotherapy (CT) was associated with the greatest benefit to progression-free survival (PFS), whereas amivantamab + lazertinib yielded the greatest benefit to overall survival (OS). Osimertinib + CT yielded the best PFS outcomes irrespective of patient gender or EGFR mutation subtype. The combinations of amivantamab + lazertinib and icotinib + CT provided the best respective PFS outcomes in Asian and elderly patient cohorts. With respect to OS outcomes, afatinib + cetuximab provided the best outcomes for 19del and male cases, whereas dacomitinib provided the best OS for females and cases with L858R mutations. The respective gefitinib + CT and erlotinib + bevacizumab regimens were also associated with the greatest improvements in the OS of Asian and elderly cases.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">This NMA revealed that cases with EGFR-mutated NSCLC may benefit from different first-line treatment regimens according to their clinicopathological characteristics. On the whole, osimertinib plus CT and amivantamab plus lazertinib emerged as the most noticeable treatment modalities for such cases.

2,"Recent trends and future directions for lung cancer mortality in Europe Lung cancer mortality patterns throughout Europe are very heterogeneous and largely reflect past smoking habits. In order to clarify the changing patterns of lung cancer in Europe we have plotted the overall lung cancer trends among men and women for 20 countries from 1950 up to 1998. Furthermore, using a Bayesian age-period-cohort approach, we have calculated 5 year projections of lung cancer rate up to 2003. Finally, we make some comments on probable future trends by analysing recent trends in adults aged <55 years. Lung cancer mortality rates up to age 75 years portray a general trend of decreasing lung cancer rates among men and increasing lung cancer rates among women. Exceptions to this decrease among men include Hungary where not only are current mortality rates much higher than previously observed in any other country (at 76.7 out of 100,000 in 1998) but they are projected to increase further in the short term. Rates among adults aged <55 years have recently peaked, indicating that overall rates are likely to peak in the next decade. Among women, rapid increases have been observed in Denmark, Netherlands, Hungary, Ireland and UK. Whereas Ireland and UK rates have started to decrease and are projected to continue falling, rates in the other three countries are projected to increase further. Trends in women aged <55 years indicate that rates in Danish women will peak in the next decade, whereas lung cancer rates among Dutch women are likely to continue increasing. Rates in Hungarian women are likely to increase and will surpass the current high rate observed in Denmark."
2,"Integration of clinical phenoms and metabolomics facilitates precision medicine for lung cancer. Lung cancer is a common malignancy that is frequently associated with systemic metabolic disorders. Early detection is pivotal to survival improvement. Although blood biomarkers have been used in its early diagnosis, missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis still exist due to the heterogeneity of lung cancer. Integration of multiple biomarkers or trans-omics results can improve the accuracy and reliability for lung cancer diagnosis. As metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of lung cancer, metabolites, specifically lipids might be useful for lung cancer detection, yet systematic characterizations of metabolites in lung cancer are still incipient. The present study profiled the polar metabolome and lipidome in the plasma of lung cancer patients to construct an inclusive metabolomic atlas of lung cancer. A comprehensive analysis of lung cancer was also conducted combining metabolomics with clinical phenotypes. Furthermore, the differences in plasma lipid metabolites were compared and analyzed among different lung cancer subtypes. Alcohols, amides, and peptide metabolites were significantly increased in lung cancer, while carboxylic acids, hydrocarbons, and fatty acids were remarkably decreased. Lipid profiling revealed a significant increase in plasma levels of CER, PE, SM, and TAG in individuals with lung cancer as compared to those in healthy controls. Correlation analysis confirmed the association between a panel of metabolites and TAGs. Clinical trans-omics studies elucidated the complex correlations between lipidomic data and clinical phenotypes. The present study emphasized the clinical importance of lipidomics in lung cancer, which involves the correlation between metabolites and the expressions of other omics, ultimately influencing clinical phenotypes. This novel trans-omics network approach would facilitate the development of precision therapy for lung cancer."
