4,"Changing natural history of differentiated thyroid cancer. The incidence of thyroid cancer has been increasing in many countries over the last 30 years. In the USA, the incidence of thyroid cancer increased from 3.6/100.000 people in 1973 to 8.7/100.000 people in 2002 [1]. This phenomenon is mainly due to an increase in the papillary histotype, which raised from 2.7 to 7.7/100.000, a 2.9-fold increase. The same trend has been reported in Europe [2]. The bulk of the increase is probably the results of better detection of small cancer, measuring 1.5 cm or less. Despite increasing incidence, the mortality from papillary thyroid cancer remained stable (0.5 deaths/100.000 in both 1973 and 2002) [1]. A recent study by Pagano et al. [3] confirm this trend in thyroid cancer patients diagnosed in a tertiary hospital in north Italy, in an area characterized by moderate iodine deficiency. The authors compared the epidemiological and clinico-pathological features of patients according to the time of diagnosis (1997–2005 and 2006–2010). The cut off of 2005 was chosen because it is coincident with the introduction of iodine prophylaxis and with the adoption of international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of thyroid cancer [4, 5]. The main finding is that in more recent years, cancers were diagnosed at an earlier stage, in agreement with the similar observation in other European and North American countries. Increased scrutiny of the thyroid gland, mainly by neck ultrasound, is the most likely explanation for this phenomenon, but the other possibility is that some, as yet unknown, carcinogens in the environment might play a role. Up to now, the only established environmental risk factor for thyroid carcinoma is exposure to ionizing radiation, and the risk, particularly of papillary carcinoma, is greater in subjects of younger age at exposure, as demonstrated following the explosion of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in 1986 [6]. According to a network of populationbased cancer registries in Italy [7], the temporal trend for thyroid cancer in the period 1988–2002 showed a statistically significant increase of incidence rates in both male and females, that overall showed an annual percent increase of 4.0 % similar to the 3.8 % observed in USA [1]. Based on temporal relationship, it has been claimed that the increase might be a consequence of the Chernobyl fallout. However, no increase in thyroid gland abnormalities, such as nodularity or cancer, was found in northern Italy, among children already born at the time of Chernobyl nuclear accident, when examined 10 years after [8]. This epidemiological evidence does not favor any link between the Chernobyl accident and the increased incidence of thyroid carcinoma in countries other than Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia. Of particular interest is the finding that nearly 20 % of the patients reported by Pagano et al. [3] had an occupational exposure in textile industries. Although the study did not include a control group with the same exposure, the finding recalls a previous Chinese study [9] documenting an association between thyroid cancer and possible exposure to formaldehyde and benzene during long-term employment in textile industries. Another novel finding of Pagano et al. [3] is that cancers diagnosed between 2006 and 2010 presented more frequent association with autoimmune thyroid phenomena. The last observation might be linked to the augmented iodine intake after establishment of iodine prophylaxis in the country and it is in keeping with the evidence that in countries with high nutritional iodine intake the incidence of autoimmune thyroid disorders is higher compared to countries with F.

4,"Contemporary application of classical techniques in thyroid scanning The thyroid consists of two lobes that are connected by an isthmus. It is located anterior to the trachea between the cricoid cartilage and the suprasternal notch. It produces two related hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). Benign nodules and thyroid cancer are relatively common and amenable to detection by physical examination. Nuclear medicine is a part of medicine that uses radioisotopes for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases.; ; Technetium-99m-pertechnate is widely used for imaging the thyroid gland. 99mTc is trapped by thyroid, but unlike iodine, it does not undergo organification and remains in the gland for a relatively short period. Imaging is done 30 min after administration of radiotracer. 123Iodine has a short physical half-life of 13 h. Both tracers are pure gamma emitters. 131Iodine is worse for imaging (except metastases in thyroid differentiated cancer) because it gives a high absorbed radiation dose related to the long physical half-life of 8 days and beta emissions. It is ideal for the treatment of thyroid disease, and used in the management of differentiated thyroid cancer, Graves’ disease, and toxic nodular goitre.; ; Indications for thyroid scintigraphy and RAI uptake are: differential diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis, before treatment with radioiodine 131I, measuring of goitre volume, ectopic goitre, congenital hypothyroidism. Other indications are metastases of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (eg. papillary or follicular cancer). Very rarely, ovarian goitre is present.; ; The normal image of thyroid scan shows the typical butterfly shape (a shield shape according to the ancient Greeks), the position in the anterior neck area, the regular contour, without any interruption or mismatches. The distribution of the radiotracer is homogenous with intense, usually warm color in the middle of each lobe related to it thickness. The margins have a less intense color because of the decreased quantity of thyroid tissue. Physiologically the right lobe is often larger than the left one. There is imaging on the scan of the salivary glands.; ; Nuclear imaging of Graves’ disease is characterized by an enlarged gland and increased tracer uptake (usually more than 55%) that is distributed homogenously.; ; Toxic multinodular goitre shows irregular distribution of tracer and a normal or slightly elevated 131I uptake. The irregular tracer distribution is consistent with heterogeneity in cell function and growth, and the presence of micro- and macronodules. Large and discrete hyperfunctioning nodules may be associated with poor uptake in the extranodular thyroid tissue. The latter consists of suppressed normal tissue with less tracer accumulation. After 131I treatment, the areas that were cold may appear warm.; ; Although the use of fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) has diminished the use of thyroid scans in the evaluation of solid thyroid nodules, the functional features of thyroid nodules have some prognostic significance. So-called cold nodules, which have diminished or no tracer uptake, are usually benign. However, these nodules are more likely to be malignant (5-10%) than hot nodules, which are almost always benign.; ; Subacute thyroiditis is associated with very low uptake because of follicular cell damage and TSH suppression. Drug-induced thyrotoxicosis or factitious thyrotoxicosis are also associated with low uptake.; ; Thyroid scanning is used in the follow-up of thyroid cancer. After thyroidectomy and ablation using 131I, there is diminished tracer uptake in the thyroid bed, allowing the detection of metastatic thyroid cancer remnants that retain the ability to transport radioiodine. Whole body scans using 2-5 mCi (74-185 MBq) 131I are performed after thyroid hormone withdrawal to rise the TSH concentration or after the administration of rhTSH.; ; Radioiodine 131I may be also used for treatment benign or malignant thyroid disorders."
4,"Thyroid cancer and Delphian node. The manuscript published in this volume of the European Archives of Otolaryngology discusses the incidence and impact of pre-laryngeal nodal metastasis in thyroid cancer [1]. The authors have used the title pre-laryngeal synonymous to Delphian nodes. The subject of Delphian node metastasis in thyroid cancer is well described for a number of years however interestingly there is very little original data published on the incidence of Delphian node metastasis in thyroid cancer except in the recent literature. The Australian group (Isaacs et al. [2, 3]) published their experience of large number of patients in whom Delphian nodes were removed and the incidence of metastasis was noted to be approximately 21 %. Our group at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center looked at more than 100 patients with incidence of metastatic disease to be 25 % [4]. The authors in the present manuscript have reviewed their prospective experience of 67 patients undergoing prelaryngeal (Delphian node biopsy) with a metastatic incidence of 19.4 %. The authors have done a good job on correlating the incidence of metastatic disease to the highrisk thyroid cancer features such as size of tumor, extrathyroidal extension and isthmus involvement. These prognostic factors are extremely well defined both in terms of overall prognosis in patients with thyroid cancer and the incidence of nodal metastasis, be that to the Delphian node or the paratracheal or lateral jugular nodes. The authors have clearly reported higher incidence of paratracheal nodal metastasis in patients with positive Delphian node. Some of us who routinely look for the Delphian node are amazed that the node is generally hidden under the fascia covering the crico-thyroid muscle and extending between the cricoid and thyroid cartilages. Unless one opens this fascia, the node may not be apparent. Occasionally, the node may be misrecognized as a pyramidal lobe of thyroid. It is important to explore this area. There is always a small vein crossing the cricoid cartilage which needs to be carefully secured to avoid intraoperative bleeding or postoperative development of hematoma. Clearly, the authors have added their own series to the recent few publications with high incidence of Delphian node positivity. The more you look for the Delphian node, the more one is likely to find the node and approximately 20–25 % of the patients will have positive Delphian nodes. Clearly, the patients with positive Delphian node are more likely to have other central compartment positive nodes however it is quite clear that this nodal metastasis probably does not have a major impact on the overall prognosis in patients with well-differentiated thyroid cancer. Its impact in patients with medullary thyroid cancer remains unclear as the experience is quite minimal in medullary thyroid cancer, however, we have noted some of the recurrences in medullary thyroid cancer especially in the Delphian area. The recent publication from the American Thyroid Association has described the central compartment as the area extending between the hyoid to the innominate vessels and from carotid to carotid laterally [5]. Interestingly, there are hardly any lymph nodes above the superior pole of the thyroid requiring extensive dissection between the hyoid to the superior pole of the thyroid however, the Delphian node removal should be a part of the proper central compartment clearance. We have used frozen section generously to evaluate the Delphian node. It is unlikely the positive frozen section would change the surgical procedure however if the Delphian node is positive, we are more A. R.

4,"Thyroid Cancer: 1999 Update and Evaluation of Solitary Thyroid Nodules Thyroid nodules are common; it is estimated that approximately 4% to 7% of the adult American population has a palpable thyroid nodule, and autopsy and high-resolution ultrasonography studies suggest that up to 50% of adults may have nodules within their thyroid gland.1,2 In contrast, malignant thyroid nodules are relatively rare; with approximately 17,200 new cases of thyroid cancer reported each year, malignant thyroid nodules represent only 1% of all malignancies and 0.5% of all cancer-related deaths.3,4 Because the overwhelming majority of thyroid nodules are benign, the clinician is faced with the difficult task of trying to identify the small number of patients with malignant nodules, which require surgical treatment, among the large number of patients with benign thyroid nodules. The clinical evaluation of a solitary thyroid nodule initially involves identifying risk factors that may increase the probability that a given nodule is malignant. These characteristics include prior neck irradiation; family history; age; whether or not the nodule is solitary; characteristics of the nodule, including size, consistency, and/or fixation; whether there are any enlarged lymph nodes; hoarseness; and pressure symptoms. Although thyroid function tests are often done, it is unusual for thyroid cancer to cause significant alterations in thyroid function. Other modalities that have been used in differentiating benign nodules from malignant ones include thyroid suppression therapy, cervical ultrasonography, and thyroid scintigraphy. First, thyroid suppression therapy, although frequently used, has not been shown to cause a statistically significant decrease in the size of nodules when compared with placebos in recent studies.5,6 There are also numerous reports of nodules that decreased in size during suppression therapy but subsequently turned out to be malignant.7 Second, cervical ultrasonography can identify extremely small nodules in the range of 1 mm in diameter; however, there are no ultrasonographic criteria that are pathognomonic for malignancy.8 Third, thyroid scintigraphy has been used enthusiastically in the past to differentiate between benign and malignant nodules. If one looks at the scintigraphic characteristics of all nodules, 84.0% are cold (nonfunctioning), 10.5% are warm (having uniform tracer uptake), and 4.0% are hot (hyperfunctioning).9,10 Cancer is present in approximately 16% of cold nodules, 9% of warm nodules, and 4% of hot nodules. Therefore, if a nodule is cold, there is an 87% sensitivity for cancer, but specificity is only 30%. Over the past 10–15 years, fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy has emerged as the most accurate and cost-efficient way to differentiate benign from malignant nodules with an accuracy rate approaching 95%.11 FNA From the Department of Surgery (D.S.T.), Duke University, Durham, North Carolina; Department of Surgery (A.R.S.), Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, New York; Department of Surgery (R.A.U.), The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland; Department of Medical Specialties, Endocrinology (S.I.S.) and Department of Surgical Oncology (D.B.E.), The University of Texas M.

4,"Comment on Kasai et al.: Clinical profile of long-term survivors of breast or thyroid cancer with metastatic spinal tumours Dear Editor,; ; We read with great interest the paper by Kasai et al. [4] published in International Orthopaedics. We congratulate the authors on their work. We agree with them on one point and disagree on another one. The first is that a long time (above 5 years) between diagnosis of the thyroid cancer and the operation for the spinal metastases would be a good prognostic sign. However, we disagree that the “surgical strategy for spinal metastases” developed by us [5] would not expect survival in patients with spinal metastases from thyroid cancer.; ; In 2002, we reviewed 14 cases of thyroid cancer spinal metastases treated between December 1984 and July 2000 in the Orthopedic Department, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa, Japan. The patients included 9 females and 5 males. The primary tumor was follicular carcinoma in 10 and papillary carcinoma in 4. Four patients (28.6%) had presented with spinal metastases without a history of thyroid cancer and one patients presented with spinal metastases 14 years after excision of a thyroid lesion diagnosed as follicular adenoma. The remaining 9 patients developed their spinal metastases after a mean of 8.2 years from diagnosis of thyroid cancer (range 0.25–22 years). In total, those 14 patients received 25 operations [1]. When we applied the criteria suggested by Kasai et al. [4] on our patients, we found that five patients had their spinal metastases 5 years or more after diagnosis of thyroid cancer primary tumour; four out of those five patients (80%) survived for more than 5 years (mean 98.5, range 78–124 months). The fifth patient died 33 months after the operative intervention for the spinal metastases [1]. So, we completely agree with Kasai et al. [4] that a long time span (above 5 years) between diagnosis of the thyroid cancer and the operation for the spinal metastases would be a good prognostic sign with about 80% of the patients surviving for more than 5 years. However, we disagree with the conclusion regarding the invalidity of the surgical strategy for spinal metastases in survival predilection in cases of thyroid cancer. We reviewed the validity of the surgical strategy for spinal metastases in the same 14 cases of thyroid cancer spinal metastases. The strategy scores were detected for the 25 operations, whether performed before or after development of the strategy. Postoperative survival was detected and compared between different scores. Total scores after strategy application were 2 (7 operations; 28%), 3 (11 operations; 44%), 4 (2 operations, 8%) and 5 (5 operations, 20%). No patient had scores from 6–10 at the time of any operation. Survival after operations with scores 2, 3, 4 and 5 were 75.6 ± 25.8, 32.6 ± 27.8, 23 and 18.4 ± 9.8 months, respectively. Survival correlates with the score with correlation coefficient equals -0.68 (P = 0.005). Survival with scores of 2 and 3 after operation (candidates of long-term local control) was 51.4 ± 34.1 months while survival after operations for patients having the scores of 4 and 5 (candidates of middle-term local control) was 19.7 ± 10.5 months. The difference was statistically significant (P = 0.04) [2, 3]. From these results, we can conclude that the surgical strategy for spinal metastases would successfully predict survival in patients with thyroid cancer spinal metastases."
4,"New genomic somatic amplifications and deletions in papillary thyroid cancer. There have been striking changes in the epidemiology of thyroid cancer worldwide with higher incidence rates, with low-risk or clinically less significant papillary thyroid cancer accounting for more than 80 % of new cases each year [1, 2]. During this change in epidemiology, our knowledge in the genetic and genomic alterations associated with thyroid cancer initiation and or progression has also expanded tremendously [3]. As precision medicine is becoming a reality for some solid malignancies, the application of new knowledge to the management of thyroid cancer is going to be imperative to precisely treat patients based on the genetics/genomics of their tumor, especially when it is found to be associated with disease behavior [4]. The study by Passon and colleagues from Italy reports new findings based on a careful analysis of 27 papillary thyroid cancer samples using high-resolution comparative genomic hybridization [5]. The investigators found that genomic amplifications were higher in high/intermediaterisk group tumors and that genomic deletions were higher in low-risk tumors based on the American Thyroid Association (ATA) risk stratification system. Several of these genomic amplifications and deletions were recurrent (occurred in more than 20 % of tumor samples) and several of the genes in the chromosomal loci with deletions have been implicated to be involved in thyroid cancer or their expression is dysregulated in cancer. The most frequent amplifications that were detected in 2q35, 4q26, and 4q34.1 contained FN1, PDE5A, and GALNTL6, respectively. The 2q35 locus is thought to be a breast cancer susceptibility locus, and FN1 expression was found to be restricted to thyroid cancer samples and absent in benign lesions [6, 7]. Interestingly, 60 % of the cases with 2q35 amplification were TNM Stage I according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system, whereas more than 70 % were considered intermediate/high risk according to the ATA risk classification system. Although both systems include some of the same variables, the AJCC staging system also includes the patient’s age at diagnosis so that patients younger than 45 years even with lymph node and or distant metastases are considered as having only stage I/II disease. Also the ATA risk stratification system includes postoperative serum thyroglobulin level measurement. Thus, these factors likely explain the somewhat discrepant results. The amplification in 4q26 involving PDE5 was more prevalent in intermediate/highrisk cancers. Interestingly, studies have shown that tumors with high expression level of PDE5 have lower mRNA expression of differentiation markers or thyroid-specific genes (TG, TSHR, TPO, and NIS) [8]. Thus, PDE5 could be involved in thyroid cancer initiation, progression, or even radioiodine resistance. The authors also investigated the BRAF mutation status in the tumors analyzed but found no significant association with genomic amplifications or deletions. Most, but not all, studies have suggested that papillary thyroid cancers with BRAF mutations are more aggressive and that it is one of the most frequent genetic alterations in papillary thyroid cancer [3, 9]. Passon and colleague did find that 8 of the BRAF V600E mutant samples were in patients with ATA intermediate-risk papillary thyroid cancers. It would be interesting to know if the genomic deletion status in addition to BRAF mutation status could better stratify ATA low-risk from intermediate/high-risk papillary thyroid cancer or even outperform & Electron Kebebew kebebewe@mail.nih.gov"
4,"TLR-10 polymorphism and papillary thyroid cancer: one more SNP to consider? Activated toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway has been reported in several endocrine neoplasms and has been found to be associated with the upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines. These cytokines are widely known as critical mediators of tumorigenesis. The stimulation of antitumor immunity through the activation of the TLR pathway can lead to the inhibition of the carcinogenesis process. However, TLRs have been considered as putative therapeutic target in various human cancers. A chronic inflammation in the absence of infection induces oxidative stress, DNA damage, and tissue damage promoting tumorigenesis. Thus, TLRs can be viewed as having a double-edged sword function. Accumulating evidences show the association between over-activation of TLR and cancer progression and TLRsignaling molecules are often involved in tumor progression. For example, TLR4 expression has been described in several human cancer, including intestinal [1], breast, and prostate cancers [2, 3] and TLR3 in papillary thyroid cancer and cervical carcinoma [4]. Several studies support that TLR activation via TLR-adaptors such as MyD88 induces NFkB translocation to the nucleus. This induces proinflammatory cytokine secretion (IL6 and IL1), antiapoptotic factors (Bcl-XL, cIAP1, ABL), as well as, pro-angiogenic factors expression (VEGF). High expression of TLR3 has been reported in a papillary thyroid cancer cell line which is consistent with its overexpression in human papillary thyroid cancer in vivo [5]. As one of the main mediator of lipopolysaccharide action, the lack or overexpression of TLR4 has also been associated with aggressive follicular thyroid cancers [6]. In this issue of Endocrine, Kim et al. [7] report that single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in TLR10 is associated with tumor size in patients with papillary thyroid cancer. TLR-1-TLR6-TLR-10 is located on the same chromosome and forms a cluster, and thus was the rationale for the authors to analyze these three TLR SNPs. They found that only a missense SNP in TLR10 (rs11466653, Met326Thr) showed a significant association with small tumor size (\1 cm). SNPs in the TLR-1-TLR6-TLR-10 cluster have been associated with increased risk of prostate cancer [8]. Altered TLR-10 signaling in papillary thyroid cancer may be involved in the interplay between inflammation and tumorigenesis. For example, it has been shown by several groups that IL-6, IL-1, and VEGFA are important cytokines in thyroid carcinogenesis [9–11]. Most importantly, common somatic mutations in papillary thyroid cancer such us RET/PTC rearrangements and BRAF are involved in inflammation, where they have been shown to be involved in inflammatory response and in the infiltration of innate suppressive inflammatory cells in papillary thyroid cancer [12]. Thus, a cooperation of dysregulated TLR signaling pathway in the inflammatory response of microcarcinoma seems plausible. Based on our current knowledge, TLR-10 expression seems to be restricted to immune cells like B cells or dendritic cells. Lymphocytic and dendritic cell infiltration is higher in patients with papillary thyroid cancer as compared to those with benign thyroid tumors [13]. Thus, the missense TLR-10 SNP reported by Kim and colleagues may influence the amount of lymphocytic infiltration in patients with small papillary thyroid cancer. Although lymph node metastasis and multifocality are important M. Boufraqech C. Fassassi E.

4,"Compromised Outcome of Papillary Thyroid Cancer at Low-Volume Treatment Centers: Practice Makes Perfect? The intimate relationship between volume and outcome for nearly every major type of surgery is ubiquitous. Highvolume hospital care is associated with significantly lower mortality rates compared to low-volume hospitals. The effect of high surgeon volume accounts for the majority of the effect of high hospital volume in complex procedures. Nobel laureate and masterful Swiss surgeon Emil Theodor Kocher recognized the importance of surgical volume in improving outcomes in thyroid surgery. Kocher reported an operative mortality rate of 13 % for his first 100 thyroid procedures. By 1912, Kocher was able to reduce his mortality rate of thyroidectomy to less than 0.5 % after performing over 5000 thyroid excisions. He demonstrated a significant reduction in operative mortality with increasing experience. In the modern era, the association recognized by Kocher between provider volume and improved patient outcome has persisted. Reames et al. demonstrated that higher-volume hospitals had significantly lower mortality rates compared to lower-volume hospitals for eight different complex procedures in over 3 million patients. Data also show a significant relationship between surgeon volume and surgical morbidity in thyroid operations. Although the majority of thyroid operations are still performed by lowvolume surgeons, national trends in thyroid surgery over the last two decades exhibit an increase in thyroid surgical procedures performed by high-volume surgeons with a decrease in the incidence of complications, specifically recurrent laryngeal nerve injury and hypocalcemia. In addition, high-volume surgeons were more likely to perform total thyroidectomy and neck dissection as compared to low-volume surgeons. Hauch et al. evaluated the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (2003–2009) of all adult patients who underwent total thyroidectomy and unilateral thyroidectomy. They found that total thyroidectomy was associated with a significantly higher risk of complications compared to unilateral thyroidectomy in both lowand high-volume surgeons; however, higher surgeon volume was associated with improved patient outcome. Mitchell et al. demonstrated that operations for thyroid cancer led to avoidable reoperations more frequently if performed at low-volume centers. The initial operations requiring avoidable reoperations included errors in judgment concerning lymph node dissection or technical errors in incomplete thyroid resection. Furthermore, Schneider and colleagues found that higher-volume surgeons had better oncologic outcomes for thyroid cancer. In this issue, Youngwirth et al. report the first study examining margin status after total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer in the National Cancer Data Base (1998–2006). A total of 31,129 adult patients with thyroid cancer met the inclusion criterion of patients who underwent total thyroidectomy. By multivariable analysis, the authors identified specific factors for patients with papillary thyroid cancer undergoing total thyroidectomy that led to a poor outcome in survival. These factors included patient factors (male gender, advanced age, African American race), socioeconomic factors (low income, government insurance), cancer stage (large tumor size, positive lymph nodes, distant metastases), absence of radioactive iodine treatment, and microscopically and macroscopically positive surgical margin status. Of these independent factors, which compromised patient survival, the authors recognized that only surgical margin status could be potentially controlled. They evaluated the factors associated with positive margin status in patients undergoing surgical resection for thyroid cancer. Their study Society of Surgical Oncology 2015"
4,"Analysis of the correlation between high iodized salt intake and the risk of thyroid nodules: a large retrospective study. BACKGROUND Currently, whether daily excess iodized salt intake increases the risk of thyroid nodules and even thyroid cancer remains controversial. Our research group aimed to provide a theoretical basis for the clinical guidance of daily iodized salt intake and the prevention of thyroid nodules through a retrospective analysis of the correlation between daily iodized salt intake and the risk of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer in Hunan, China. METHODS This study retrospectively analyzed the data of subjects who underwent a physical examination at the Health Management Center, Third Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019. Subjects enrolled in this study underwent thyroid ultrasonography and tests to urine routines and liver and kidney function, and all subjects completed a questionnaire survey. The daily iodized salt intake of the study subjects was estimated based on spot urine methods (Tanaka). A multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the relationship between daily iodized salt intake and thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer. RESULTS Among the 51,637 subjects included in this study, the prevalence of thyroid nodules was 40.25%, and the prevalence of thyroid cancer was 0.76%; among all enrolled subjects, only 3.59% had a daily iodized salt intake less than 5 g. In addition, we found that a daily intake of more than 5 g of iodized salt was not only an independent risk factor for the occurrence of thyroid nodules (odds ratio (OR): 2.08, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.86-2.31, p   60 years with a daily iodized salt intake of more than 5 g compared to subjects aged  60 years with a daily iodized salt intake of more than 5 g and those aged < 60 years with a daily iodized salt intake of no more than 5 g (OR: 2.15, 95% CI: 0.52-8.95, p = 0.281). The risk of thyroid nodules was not increased in physically active subjects with a daily iodized salt intake of more than 5 g compared to physically inactive subjects with a daily iodized salt intake of no more than 5 g (OR: 1.12, 95% CI: 0.97-1.28, p = 0.111). The same protective effect of physical activity was observed for thyroid cancer in subjects whose daily iodized salt intake exceeded 5 g. The risk of thyroid nodules was reduced for subjects with an education level of postgraduate and above, even when the daily iodized salt intake exceeded 5 g, compared to those with high school education and below and a daily iodized salt intake of no more than 5 g (OR: 0.79, 95% CI: 0.66-0.93, p = 0.005); however, a protective effect of education level on the occurrence of thyroid cancer was not observed. Independent risk factors affecting daily iodized salt intake greater than 5 g included age, triglycerides, family history of tumors, physical activity, and marital status. CONCLUSIONS Daily intake of more than 5 g of iodized salt increased the risk of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer, while increased physical activity and education level reduced the risk of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer caused by iodized salt intake."
4,"Picture of thyroid cancer in 2012 Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most common tumour of the endocrine system. In Poland, the standardized incidence rate in 2010 was 6.7 for women, 1.5 for men and it is characterized by a constant increase. Patients with thyroid cancer make up a very heterogeneous group with a differential clinical course - from an indolent to a fast progressing which is the cause of a patient’s death.; ; As our studies indicate, in recent years papillary thyroid cancer with a diameter of less than 10 mm dominates among the cases of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). Such situation requires the verification of the approach to the diagnostic process - moving the diagnostic burden from a palpable examination to an ultrasound method and indicating an outbreak to cytological and molecular examination. The open problem is reducing the diameter of lesions displayed in ultrasonography, which should be subjected to further assessment.; ; Surgical treatment with a total thyroidectomy with central lymph node dissection is a common procedure. Supplementary treatment with 131I has a documented value in the cases of advanced TC. Controversy arouses with the usage of 131I in patients with a lower stadium. The results of ESTIMABL and HiLo studies indicate high effectiveness of ablation with the use of an isotope with an activity of 30mCi, regardless of endogenous or exogenous TSH stimulation.; ; While monitoring the patients with DTC, the main tool is an ultrasound examination of a neck and thyroglobulin (TG) measurement. High hopes are connected with the use of ultrasensitive TG measurements under exogenous or endogenous TSH stimulation.; ; Isotope imaging is reserved only for patients with the suspicion of a relapse or metastases. To examinations used in these cases, a PET technique with the use of 124I or FDG was joined.; ; Due to a very differentiated clinical course of TC, prognostic indicators of worse prognoses requiring more aggressive measures are searched for. High expectations were connected with a BRAF mutation. Many studies have indicated that the BRAFV600E mutation can correlate with a more aggressive clinical course of papillary thyroid cancer and with a worse prognosis. The results of our studies seem not to confirm this opinion - the high mutation frequency (72.5%) in papillary thyroid cancer of very good prognosis with a diameter of less than 10 mm.; ; Recent years have brought new therapeutic possibilities for the patients with the spread of the disease and with the lack of iodine uptake.

The other agents are in the course of clinical studies.; ; The most important problems for the future are: in the field of diagnostics - the development of molecular methods which improve the accuracy of cytological diagnosis; in the field of therapy - the identification of prognostic indicators of a worse disease course and a more aggressive treatment of this group of patients; seeking new medications aiming according to the pathway of oncogenesis."
4,"Molecular mechanism of thyroid hormone action in carcinogenesis Thyroid hormones, 3,5,3'5'-tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine) and 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) contribute to the regulation of key cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and metabolism. Thus, deregulation of thyroid hormone pathway can result in serious disturbances of cellular physiology such as those observed in tumoral transformation. The intra- and extracellular concentrations of thyroid hormones (TH) are regulated by three types of iodothyronine deiodinases (DIO1, DIO2, and DIO3). These enzymes catalyze two types of reactions: deiodination in position 5' of iodothyronines (catalyzed by DIO1 and DIO2), resulting in activation of thyroid hormones, and deiodination in position 5 of iodothyronines (catalyzed by DIO1 and DIO3), which results in inactivation of thyroid hormones. Changes in expression and activity of iodothyronine deiodinases result in modulations of thyroid hormone concentrations and thus influence cellular processes. The actions of thyroid hormone are mediated by thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) which influence intracellular processes via modulation of expression of target genes. In this process, known as genomic mechanism of TH action, thyroid hormone receptors act as transcription factors whose activity is modulated by the presence of ligand, T3. TH can also influence cellular processes via non-genomic pathways in which TH modulate activity of membrane or intracellular receptors and activate different intracellular signaling pathways, involving protein kinases, for instance PI3K, and Akt/PKB.; ; In the process of carcinogenesis the signaling pathway of thyroid hormones is disturbed. This is illustrated by observations of mutations and deregulated expression of thyroid hormone receptors, altered expression and activity of iodothyronine deiodinases as well as decreased intracellular concentrations of T3 in tumours. Whether these changes play a causative role in the process of carcinogenesis is currently a matter of discussion. In vitro studies in cancer cell lines and mouse models showed that increased expression of DIO3 together with enhanced proteasomal degradation of DIO2 in basal cell carcinoma stimulates tumoral proliferation. Moreover, thyroid hormone receptor beta-1 was shown to act as a powerful suppressor of tumour invasiveness and metastasis in mouse models of breast cancer and hepatocarcinoma. These studies suggest that local tissue hypothyroidism may rather support tumoral transformation and even initiate enhanced cancerous proliferation. In contrast, studies on the effects of systemic hypothyroidism and cancer risk show opposite or conflicting results. For instance, hypothyroidism was associated with increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, and cancers of lung and prostate. In case of breast cancer, different studies reported that hypothyroidism was linked to reduced risk of the disease in humans while when studied in mice, hypothyroidism reduced tumour growth but enhanced metastasis. Finally, studies performed on cell line and mouse xenografts of thyroid and kidney cancers showed that inhibition of integrin-mediated thyroid hormone signaling can effectively result in inhibition of tumour growth.; ; All these studies show that the role of thyroid hormones in carcinogenic process is complex and presumably depends on type of cancer and extra- or intracellular effects of TH signaling. The results showing benefits from the use of TH pathway genes in cancer treatment and diagnosis suggest that further and more in depth studies are needed."
4,"A novel long non-coding RNA, PICSAR, promotes thyroid cancer progression through the hsa-miR-320A/hsa-miR-485/RAPGEFL1 axis. Among endocrine cancers, thyroid carcinoma (TC) is the most prevalent and ranks sixth in global mortality rates. Aberrant expression of long non-coding RNA (lncRNAs) is associated with the progression of various human cancers, including TC. The role of PICSAR lncRNA (LINC00162) has been validated in different human cancers. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the expression levels and functions of lncRNA PICSAR in thyroid cancer tumorigenesis. This comprehensive approach combined in silico and in vitro methods to explore the molecular mechanisms and clinical significance of PICSAR in thyroid cancer. This work assessed the expression of the long non-coding RNA LINC00162 and identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Interactions among LINC00162, hsa-miR-320A, hsa-miR-485, and RAPGEFL1 were investigated using the LncACT and miRDB databases. Bioinformatics techniques were employed to conduct functional enrichment analysis to clarify the relevant molecular pathways. For the investigation of LINC00162 expression in TC samples, 50 matched samples of thyroid carcinoma and adjacent normal tissue were gathered. Real time PCR was used to objectively evaluate the expression levels of the targeted genes. Every tissue sample was examined pathologically. A specific siRNA was transfected into a thyroid cancer cell line to examine the functional role of LINC00162. The impact of LINC00162 silencing was then assessed by measuring the level of target genes expression following the transfection. Based on TCGA-THCA analysis and qRT-PCR on tissue samples, LINC00162 (PICSAR) was markedly overexpressed in thyroid cancer tissues compared to normal samples. However, no discernible correlation was found between LINC00162 expression and the pathological characteristics of thyroid cancer. Our bioinformatics predictions based on lncRNA-microRNA interactions demonstrate that LINC00162 acts as a molecular sponge for the downregulated microRNAs hsa-miR-320A and hsa-miR-485 in thyroid cancer. RAPGEFL1, a gene associated with the development of thyroid cancer, is upregulated in conjunction with this downregulation. The LINC00162-miRNA-RAPGEFL1 axis is involved in critical carcinogenic processes, including thiamine metabolism, cell cycle control, and folate biosynthesis, according to functional enrichment analysis. Additionally, a bioinformatics study revealed a negative association between PICSAR and the NUDT3 gene, while a positive correlation was found with the SNX18P14 gene. Thyroid cancer cells transfected with LINC00162-specific siRNA showed significant downregulation of LINC00162 and RAPGEFL1, alongside an increase in hsa-miR-320A and hsa-miR-485, ultimately inhibiting the growth of thyroid cancer. These findings suggest that targeting PICSAR may offer a treatment strategy for thyroid cancer by altering important biological processes. In conclusion, LINC00162, which is overexpressed in thyroid cancer, acts as a molecular sponge for hsa-miR-320A and hsa-miR-485, regulating key oncogenic pathways and leading to the upregulation of RAPGEFL1. These effects are reversed upon siRNA-mediated silencing of LINC00162, indicating its potential as a promising therapeutic target for thyroid cancer. RAPGEFL1 regulates the Rap signaling pathway, controlling adhesion, migration, polarity, and metabolism to maintain cellular and tissue homeostasis. Its dysregulation is linked to various diseases, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target."
4,"Effects of Aerobic Exercises Combined With Music Therapy on Fatigue and Quality of Life in Females With Thyroidectomy Following Thyroid Cancer: An Experimental Study. Background Thyroid cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the thyroid gland. Thyroid cancer is characterized by the abnormal and uncontrolled growth of cells within the thyroid gland. In recent years, the incidence of thyroid cancer has been rising globally, with a significant increase observed in India. It is more prevalent among females, who are three times more likely to be diagnosed with thyroid cancer than males. According to recent statistics, thyroid cancer constitutes approximately 4%-6% of all cancers among Indian women, with an estimated incidence rate of 8.7 per 100,000 women. Thyroidectomy is a technique performed to manage thyroid cancer. Females who undergo thyroidectomy and receive insufficient levothyroxine supplementation are more prone to experience problems such as fatigue, which can significantly affect their quality of life (QoL). Fatigue is a prevalent and discomforting symptom among oncology patients, though its prevalence can vary depending on cancer type, stage, and treatment. Exercise is becoming widely recognized as a management strategy for fatigue and for enhancing QoL. This study aims to evaluate the effects of aerobic exercise and music therapy on fatigue and QoL in females who have undergone thyroidectomy due to thyroid cancer. Fatigue will be measured using the Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS), while QoL will be assessed through the RAND SF-36 Questionnaire. The study seeks to determine how these combined interventions may help improve both physical and mental well-being in this population. Method The study was conducted in the physiotherapy outpatient department of Acharya Vinoba Bhave Rural Hospital over a duration of six months, using an experimental interventional design. A total of 30 female participants, all of whom have undergone thyroidectomy due to thyroid cancer, were selected through a simple random sampling method with allocation based on a computer-generated list. Female participants will ensure completion of the six-week session. As interventions, both aerobic exercises and music therapy were combined. The RAND SF-36 Questionnaire and FAS were utilized to examine QoL and fatigue levels before and after treatment. The student-paired t-test was applied to compare pre- and post-treatment outcomes. Result  Following six weeks of interventions, the fatigue symptom was reduced, resulting in a considerable enhancement in QoL. Post-intervention the FAS (t=13.37, p=0.0001) and RAND SF-36 (t=14.09, p=0.0001) scores improved more significantly. The level of significance was found to be p<0.0001. Conclusion Based on the findings of this study, it can be concluded that the combination of aerobic exercises and music therapy has a positive impact on the QoL of females who have undergone thyroidectomy. Additionally, these interventions were found to effectively reduce fatigue symptoms in this population. These results underscore the potential benefits of integrating aerobic exercises and music therapy into post-thyroidectomy care strategies for enhancing overall well-being."

4,"Low-risk thyroid cancer, surgical training, and radioactive iodine. Michigan have undertaken an interesting and complex study of surgeon training and use of radioactive iodine for low risk thyroid cancer patients. This study is based on several hypotheses, a questionnaire to the surgeons and correlating their training to radioactive iodine use. Clearly, management of thyroid cancer starting from extent of thyroidectomy, radioactive iodine use and extent of suppressive therapy continue to be a controversial subject and depends on experience and judgment of the treating physician. Even though there are no firm standards of practice, the general tendency in the United States appears to be total thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine ablation. Some of these decisions are made definitely by surgeons who have performed the surgical procedure; however, there is an enormous impact of endocrinologists, and the patient themselves having read extensively on Google. Clearly, trying to correlate these issues of treatment, referring specifically to the surgeon training, parent specialty, and attending the professional meeting may be difficult. In any case, the authors have made a genuine effort to correlate these issues and concluded that training with a thyroid surgeon and attending one or more professional society meeting a year was associated with lower rate of hospital based RAI use. Clearly, these conclusions may be difficult to digest because decision making regarding RAI is generally not one individual decision. The manuscript mentions Stage I thyroid cancer patients while a majority of the manuscript discusses the low risk thyroid cancer patients. Clearly, Stage I thyroid cancer patients, especially below the age of 45 with lymph node metastasis, definitely will require radioactive iodine and is quite rational approach, while in the truly low risk thyroid cancer patient, where the tumor appears to be intrathyroidal, the role of radioactive iodine is always questioned and similar opinion is reflected in the ATA guidelines. The basic conclusion that can be made out of this manuscript is the surgeon training, and the experience of the surgeon is more important in treatment policies. Having read this manuscript several times, certain important points need to be highlighted. The collection of the data and its relation to NCDB is quite complex. It should be mentioned that the average surgeon age was 51 years and the surgeon’s average years in practice was 19. This reflects the seniority of the surgeons and their training several years before the ATA guidelines and our recent multidisciplinary management of thyroid cancer. The practice distribution of thyroidectomy is also quite interesting that the general surgeons comprised of 39 %"
4,"P53 mutations in thyroid carcinoma: tidings from an old foe. The underlying mechanism leading to carcinogenesis involves genomic instability, likely related to aneuploidy. While p53 as a “guardian of the genome” is an appealing candidate as an initiator of genomic instability, its mutations or deletions usually occur late in the course of tumor progression. P53 may, however, become a target of events initiated by genomic instability. P53 is a transcription factor with multifaceted regulatory functions in the cell cycle, DNA repair and apoptosis. Inactivating p53 mutations have been described in some 50% of human cancers. These mutations are not only important in tumor progression but apparently also in the response of some tumors to chemotherapy and radiation treatment, thus to clinical outcome. P53 mutations are found in 14% of malignant thyroid tumors and are more frequent in poorly differentiated and anaplastic tumors. We have examined the mutation rates of p53 as a measure of genomic instability (hypermutability) of malignant thyroid tumors. We also wondered whether radiation enhances this tendency to genomic instability. To those ends we extracted all available entries from the p53 mutations database (http://www.perso@curies.fr), verified, extended where applicable, and supplemented that information from the original published reports. We were able to locate 100 entries. The distribution of the types of p53 aberrations in thyroid cancer was similar to those in the database as a whole. The silent mutation rate of 20%, not different from the expected 25%, is consistent with a random occurrence of these mutations. This silent mutation rate is 130 times that expected and is 7 times that of the p53 database. Moreover the distribution of p53 mutations is compatible with Poisson’s distribution, which, when considered in the context of the silent mutation rates, indicates that p53 is particularly hypermutable in thyroid cancer. Epigenetic deamination of CpG dinucleotides at highly transforming DNA-contact residues is a feature of poorly differentiated tumors and thus associated with tumor progression. The rates of p53 mutations in radiation-related thyroid cancers (15.4%) are similar to those in spontaneously arising tumors, although there was a highly significant heterogeneity (p<0.0005) in the residues mutated in the two tumor sets. None of the residues mutated in radiation-related thyroid cancer involved CpG deamination. Based on the evidence of p53 hypermutability, thyroid cancer appears to exhibit remarkable genomic instability. Spontaneous epigenetic mutational events are involved in tumor progression. While thyroid cancer related to radiation exposure does not increase the rates of p53 mutation, they exhibit mutation at residues not involved in p53/DNA interface."
4,"A gene-disease association study of IL18 in thyroid cancer: genotype and haplotype analyses Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of the endocrine system, and genetic factors have been shown to be associated with its risk. Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine that induces IFN-γ production and is involved in T helper type 1 development. To determine the role of IL-18 gene in thyroid cancer susceptibility, we conducted a case–control study, and genotyped five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in IL-18 gene (−656 G/T (rs1946519), −607 C/A (rs1946518), and −137 G/C (rs187238) in the promoter region and +113 T/G (rs360718) and +127 C/T (rs360717) in 5′-untranslated region) in 105 patients with thyroid cancer and 148 healthy controls from Iranian population. Polymerase chain reaction–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP) and allele-specific primer-PCR were used for genotyping. The association of different genotypes with thyroid cancer, tumor type, and the tumor stage was analyzed. Comparing all of the patient population with the controls, TT genotype at position −656 G/T was observed to be associated with a significantly increased risk of thyroid cancer [31/105 (30.1 %) vs 19/148 (13.1 %), p = 0.002, OR 2.90, CI 1.40–5.70]. No association with thyroid cancer was found at other positions (−607 C/A, −137 G/C, +113 T/G, and +127 C/T). Excluding the patients with medullary carcinoma, and including only the ones with thyroid cancer derived from the follicular epithelium, nearly the same results were observed regarding the genotypes at position −656 G/T. Furthermore, significantly decreased risk of thyroid cancer derived from the follicular epithelium was observed upon inheritance of the homozygote genotype (CC) at position +127 C/T (40/94 (42.5 %) versus 84/148 (56.8 %) in patients and controls, respectively (OR 0.56, 95 % CI for OR 0.32–0.98, p = 0.04). Haplotype analysis indicated that among 32 possible haplotypes, TAGTT haplotype frequency was significantly higher in patients than in controls [12/188 (6.4 %) vs 2/292 (0.7 %), p = 0.0008] and this difference resisted Bonferroni correction (n = 19) and significant level set at 0.003. Nearly the same results were observed after excluding the patients with medullary carcinoma. No association was found between the SNPs and the stage of tumor. Our results suggest the increased susceptibility to thyroid cancer in subjects with TT genotype at position −656 G/T of the promoter of IL-18 gene, as well as TAGTT haplotype emerged from five studied SNPs in IL-18 gene. The data also suggest that the inheritance of +127 CC genotype may protect individuals from thyroid cancer derived from follicular epithelium."
4,"Transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy by vestibular approach in Viet Nam: surgical outcomes and long-term follow-up The transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy by vestibular approach (TOETVA) has been developed for early-stage thyroid cancer treatment as well as benign thyroid nodules worldwide including Viet Nam, with low rate of complications and excellent results. However, there has not been any comprehensive studies with a large number of patients and long-term follow-up in our country. Therefore, we conducted this study to evaluate the results of treatment by TOETVA for benign and malignant lesions of thyroid gland in Viet Nam. A prospective study was performed on 326 eligible patients who underwent TOETVA due to thyroid cancer and benign thyroid nodules in Department of Oncology and Palliative Care, Hanoi Medical University Hospital from July 2018 to April 2021. The clinical, surgical, and pathological characteristics, postoperative complications, and visual analog scale (VAS, 0–10 cm) score in day 1, 4, and 7 after surgery, long-term oncological and surgical outcomes were recorded. The mean age was 36.9 ± 9.8 years. 231 patients (70.9%) were diagnosed with differentiated cancer and 95 patients (29.1%) were diagnosed benign tumors of thyroid gland. In the cancer group, 12 patients (5.2%) undergone TOETVA had T3b-intraoperative-stage diagnosis, 219 patients (92.2%) were diagnosed T1 according to AJCC 8th. After 1 month of surgery, among thyroid cancer patients, there was no abnormality reported by thyroid scintigraphy and neck ultrasound as well as in unstimulated-Tg and anti-Tg values. The mean number lymph-node dissected in the cancer group was 6.1 ± 4.1 (range 0–21 nodes). However, only 2.6 ± 1.8 metastasis nodes were discovered (range 1–8 nodes), and the maximum size of these nodes was less than 2 mm. 81 patients presented occult lymph-node metastasis among thyroid cancer patients with cN0 stage (account for 35%). The occult lymph-node metastasis was 34.2% and 50% in patients diagnosed with T1 and T3b groups, respectively. The median postoperative hospital stay was 5.4 ± 0.7 days. Postoperatively, transient hypoparathyroidism was recorded in 12 patients (4.8%), transient hoarse was noted in 9 patients (3.6%), and numb chin was identified in 7 patients (2.8%). No permanent complication was noted. VAS score on first postoperative day was 4.5 ± 0.8. Median follow-up time was 12 (3–25) months. No recurrence was recorded. TOETVA is an innovative and revolutionary technique in the treatment of benign thyroid nodules, as well as early-stage differentiated thyroid cancer. The results of oncology, postoperative complications, and satisfied outcomes supported the wide application of TOETVA in Viet Nam."
4,"Recombinant human thyroid-stimulating hormone: pharmacology, clinical applications and potential uses. The major functions of pituitary thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) are to maintain the biosynthesis and secretion of the thyroid hormones L-thyroxine (T4) and L-3,5,3'triidothyronine (T3). The TSH core contains two apoproteins, the alpha and beta subunits. The alpha subunit is identical to that of pituitary follitropin, pituitary lutropin and placental chorionic gonadotropin, whereas the beta subunit is unique. TSH is a glycoprotein; the glycoprotein components of the alpha and beta subunits account for more than 10% of their mass and are essential for normal thyrotropic action and intravascular kinetics. The hypothalamic tripeptide, TSH-releasing hormone (TRH) is required for optimum TSH biosynthesis, particularly as far as addition of the glycoprotein components is concerned. TRH deficiency is associated with secretion of TSH molecules that are appropriately measured in most assays but have reduced bioactivity. In previous years the TSH used in clinical practice was obtained and purified from bovine pituitaries. Bovine TSH was used to test thyroid function and to augment the uptake of radioiodine in patients with thyroid cancer. Bovine TSH has been largely abandoned as a clinical agent because of adverse immune reactions. A recombinant human TSH (rhTSH; Thyrogen), has been approved by the US FDA for diagnostic use in patients with thyroid cancer. The alpha and beta subunits of Thyrogen are identical to those of human pituitary TSH. Thyrogen has a specific activity of approximately 4 IU/mg and is a potent stimulator of T4, T3 and thyroglobulin (Tg) secretion in healthy volunteers. It also increases thyroid iodide uptake in patients with thyroid cancer or multinodular goitre and in volunteers, even those exposed to large amounts of stable iodide. Thyroid cancer patients who have been treated by thyroidectomy and radioiodine ablation but are at risk of harbouring residual thyroid cancer are candidates for Thyrogen administration to prepare them for whole body iodide scans and serum Tg measurements. In thyroidectomised thyroid cancer patients who are unable to secrete pituitary TSH upon thyroid hormone withdrawal, Thyrogen is the only acceptable method to prepare them for these procedures. Thyrogen has been used on a compassionate basis to prepare patients for radioiodine ablation. rhTSH, in addition to being useful in the management of patients with thyroid cancer, is potentially useful to test thyroid reserve and to aid in thyroid-related nuclear medicine procedures. In the future, TSH analogues that have superagonist or antagonist properties may become available as therapeutic agents."

The growth of thyroid cancer cells was significantly inhibited when cultured in glutamine-free medium. Targeting glutamine metabolism with DON inhibited the proliferation of thyroid cancer cells. DON treatment did not promote apoptosis, but increased the proportion of cells in the S phase, accompanied by the decreased expression of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 and cyclin A. DON treatment also significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of thyroid cancer cells by reducing the expression of N-cadherin, Vimentin, matrix metalloproteinase-2, and matrix metalloproteinase-9. Non-essential amino acids, including proline, alanine, aspartate, asparagine, and glycine, were reduced in thyroid cancer cells treated with DON, which could explain the decrease of proteins involved in migration, invasion, and cell cycle. The efficacy and safety of DON prodrug (JHU-083) for thyroid cancer treatment were verified in a mouse model. In addition to suppressing the proliferation and metastasis potential of thyroid cancer in vivo, enhanced innate immune response was also observed in JHU-083-treated xenograft tumors as a result of decreased expression of cluster of differentiation 47 and programmed cell death ligand 1.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Thyroid cancer exhibited enhanced glutamine metabolism, as evidenced by the glutamine dependence of thyroid cancer cells and high expression of multiple glutamine metabolism-related genes.

4,"Expression of ANGPTL2 and its impact on papillary thyroid cancer Although the most thyroid carcinoma patients have good prognosis, around 20% of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) patients have a high rate of metastasis and recurrence after routine treatment, which causes high lethality with these patients. Tumor proliferation, metastasis, and invasion are important predictors of PTC invasiveness and are key factors in cancer-related death. Angiopoietin-like 2 (ANGPTL2), a secreted protein which belongs to the angiopoietin (ANGPTL) family, was reported to be involved in the regulation of several different type of cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. However, whether ANGPTL2 plays a role in the progression of PTC, particularly in metastasis and recurrence of PTC, remains unclear. Hence, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the level of ANGPTL2 in PTC and normal thyroid, as well as para-cancerous tissue. Furthermore, the impact of ANGPTL2 on PTC cell proliferation, metastasis, recurrence and invasion was assessed to investigate the possibility whether ANGPTL2 may become a novel target for PTC therapy and cancer prognosis. The level of ANGPTL2 in PTC and para-cancerous tissue was assessed by immunohistochemistry. The biological effect of ANGPTL2 on thyroid cancer cell proliferation and metastasis was investigated by the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assay, cell scratch test, and transwell assay. Correlations of ANGPTL2 expression levels with proliferation, migration, and metastasis of thyroid cancer were assessed with the TCGA data set and analyzed by gene set enrichment analysis. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to evaluate the utility of ANGPTL2 as a biomarker for prediction of thyroid cancer. Survival analysis was performed using the thyroid cancer database in K–M Plotter to detect correlations between survival time and ANGPTL2 levels. Current study revealed that: (1) ANGPTL2 was highly expressed in thyroid cancer in comparison with adjacent normal thyroid tissue; (2) ANGPTL2 expression was increased with thyroid tumor progression; (3) ANGPTL2 increased proliferation of thyroid cancer cells; (4) ANGPTL2 promoted migration and invasion of thyroid cancer cells; (5) high level of ANGPTL2 in thyroid cancer patients were significantly associated with a poor prognosis. The patients showed a higher metastasis and recurrence rate. ANGPTL2 promoted and enhanced proliferation, metastasis, and invasion of thyroid cancer cells. ANGPTL2 may be considered as a potential biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis of thyroid cancer patients. Further evaluation needs to be done to analyze the possibility of taking ANGPTL2 as a prognostic marker and therapeutic target for papillary thyroid cancer."

Besides, the incidence of thyroid cancer was significantly positively correlated with SDI (r = 0.48, p-value &lt; 0.001). The multiple GAM showed that for one unit increase in HDI, the risk of thyroid cancer was increased by 2.1 times (RR = 2.1, 95%CI = 2.04 to 2.19), and for one unit increase in SDI, the risk of thyroid cancer was shown to increase by 2.2 times.

While, countries with higher socioeconomic indices, report lower mortality rates. However, based on the modeling results, it can be concluded that the SDI is slightly more useful in this regard. Therefore, examining the epidemiological indices of thyroid cancer by socio-economic indices can be useful to reflect a clear image of the distribution of this cancer in each country, and can be used for planning cancer prevention strategies.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2024.

4,"Association between thyroid cancer and cardiovascular disease risk: a nationwide observation study. Treatment with levothyroxine and radioiodine contribute alternative cardiovascular function in adults with thyroid cancer. The risks of long-term cardiovascular conditions among thyroid cancer patients is unknown. This study aimed to compare the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD), ischemic stroke (IS), and atrial fibrillation (AF) among adults with thyroid cancer with that of the general population, especially when stratified by age (< 65 and ≥ 65 years old). This observational cohort study enrolled patients between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2016 with a follow-up until December 31, 2018. This study analyzed the data of Taiwanese thyroid cancer patients registered on the National Taiwan Cancer Registry Database, with CHD and IS. SIR models were used to evaluate the association between thyroid cancer and CHD, IS, AF, and cardiovascular disease outcome, stratified by age and sex. SIR analyses were also conducted for both sexes, age groups (< 65, ≥ 65 years), and different follow-up years. After excluding 128 individuals (< 20 years or ≥ 85 years old) and with missing index data, 4274 eligible thyroid cancer patients without CHD history, 4343 patients without IS history, and 4247 patients without AF history were included for analysis. During the median follow-up of 3.5 (1.2) years among thyroid cancer patients, the observed number of new CHD events was 70; IS, 30; and AF, 20, respectively. The SIR was significantly higher for CHD (SIR, 1.57; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2-1.93) among thyroid cancer patients compared with the age- and sex-specific standardized population. However, the association between thyroid cancer and the risks of IS (SIR, 0.74; 95% CI 0.47-1), cardiovascular disease (SIR, 0.88; 95% CI 0.7-1.05), and atrial fibrillation (SIR, 0.74; 95% CI 0.42-1.06) were insignificant. Moreover, stratification by age < 65 or age ≥ 65 years old and by sex for CHD suggested that the diagnosis of thyroid cancer in the young may attenuate the CHD risk (SIR, 2.08; 95% CI 1.5-2.66), and the CVD risk was constant among both men (SIR, 1.63; 95% CI 1.03-2.24) and women (SIR, 1.53; 95% CI 1.06-1.99). The patients had persistent higher CHD risk for 5 years after cancer diagnosis. Thyroid cancer survivors have a substantial CHD risk, even at long-term follow-up, especially in those patients < 65 years old. Further research on the association between thyroid cancer and CHD risk is warranted."

Primary outcomes included all-cause, cancer-specific, and noncancer mortality.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">During the median follow-up of 69 months (interquartile range, 37-109 months), 686 deaths occurred: 240 participants died from cancer, 146 from heart disease, and 300 from other causes. Separate analyses revealed that compared with a PHQ-9 score (0-4), a PHQ-9 score (5-9) was associated with a greater risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.28; 95% CI, 1.03-1.59), and a PHQ-9 score (≥ 10) was associated with greater risk of all-cause mortality (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.04-1.80) and noncancer mortality (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.01-2.10). Single sleep disturbances were not associated with mortality risk. In joint analyses, the combination of a PHQ-9 score ≥ 5 and no sleep disturbances, but not sleep disturbances, was associated with increased risks of all-cause mortality, cancer-specific mortality, and noncancer mortality. Specifically, compared with individuals with a PHQ-9 score of 0-4 and no sleep disturbances, HRs for all-cause mortality and noncancer mortality in individuals with a PHQ-9 score of 5-9 and no sleep disturbances were 1.72 (1.21-2.44) and 1.69 (1.10-2.61), respectively, and 2.61 (1.43-4.78) and 2.77 (1.27-6.07), respectively, in individuals with a PHQ-9 score ≥ 10 and no sleep disturbances; HRs for cancer-specific mortality in individuals with a PHQ-9 score ≥ 5 and no sleep disturbances were 1.95 (1.16-3.27).</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Depressive symptoms were linked to a high risk of mortality in cancer survivors.

4,"Molecular detection of circulating thyroid specific transcripts (TSHR/Tg-mRNAs) in thyroid cancer patients: Their diagnostic significance Abstract Thyroid cancer is the most prevalent endocrine malignancy. The preoperative diagnosis of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) that relies solely on fine-needle aspiration (FNAC) biopsy, sometimes possesses conflicting results. New molecular markers for thyroid cancer have been investigated with most of them based on the detection in thyroid nodules or tumor tissue specimens. Recently, it was possible to detect thyroid cancer cells in the circulation by measuring the mRNA of thyroid specific genes. Among these, thyroglobulin and more recently thyroid stimulating hormone receptor mRNAs, TSHR/Tg-mRNAs in peripheral blood might serve as cancer-specific markers. These have become promising new circulating markers for thyroid cancer. The purpose of this study is to assess TSHR/Tg-mRNAs as diagnostic molecular markers for thyroid cancer and if they can be used preoperatively in synergy with FNAC. This study was performed on 60 subjects; 20 healthy volunteers and 40 patients; including 16 patients with benign thyroid diseases, 24 patients with thyroid cancer; 18 patients with newly diagnosed (DTC) and 6 patients with recurrent thyroid cancer. Diagnosis of cancer was based on FNAC and histopathology of surgical specimens. All subjects had TSHR/Tg-mRNAs in peripheral blood measured by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR. Based on cytology/pathology; 18 patients had newly diagnosed DTC and 11 had benign thyroid disease. Preoperative FNAC was performed on 29 of 40 patients; FNAC was diagnostic in 11/18 of malignant lesions (61.1%), in 8/11 of benign lesions (72.7%), while 10/29 (34.5%) were indeterminate. TSHR/Tg-mRNAs correctly diagnosed DTC in 20/24 and 19/24 (sensitivity 83.3% and 79.1%) and benign disease in 14/16 and 13/16 (specificity 87.5% and 81.3%), respectively. With indeterminate FNA, TSHR/Tg-mRNAs correctly diagnosed DTC (follicular type) in 5/7 and benign disease in 2/3 (combined sensitivity 71.4%; specificity 66.7%). There was high concordance between RT-PCR results for TSHR-mRNA and Tg-mRNA. Of the controls 19/20 (95%) and 16/20 (80%) were negative for both TSHR- and Tg-mRNAs. With the use of a carefully selected primer pair and qualitative RT-PCR; our results indicate that TSHR/Tg-mRNAs in peripheral blood are both equally sensitive and specific markers for detection of thyroid cancer cells. Combining TSHR/Tg-mRNAs and FNAC and ultrasound enhances the preoperative detection of cancer in patients with thyroid nodules, reducing unnecessary surgeries and correctly classified most follicular cancers and could have spared surgery in patients with benign disease."

In patients' blood, the thyroid hormones content (free Triiodothyronine (fFT3), free Thyroxine (fFT4), bound Triiodothyronine (FT3), bound Thyroxine (FT4), Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)), and oxidative stress intensity (total activity of non-enzymatic antioxidant system (TAA) and the lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde (MDA), content) were investigated.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The difference in free and bound forms of T3 and T4 levels in the blood serum between patients with thyroid cancer (Group 2 and Group 3) and the control group (Group 1) was not statistically significant (F<sub>1,2</sub>=0.5, p<sub>1,2</sub>=0.8, F<sub>1,3</sub>=2.31, p<sub>1,3</sub>=0.16). In patients with thyroid cancer the TSH level significantly increased compared to the control group (Group 1) (TSH (mean ± Std error): Group 1- 1.21 ± 0.12, Group 2-2.45 ± 0.11 (F<sub>1,2</sub>=107, p<sub>1,2</sub>&lt;0.001), Group 3-2.47 ± 0.17 (F<sub>1,3</sub>=150, p<sub>1,3</sub>&lt;0.001)) and the MDA levels increased by 4-5 fold. In patients with thyroid cancer from families with cancer aggregation(Group 2), the level of TAA statistically significantly decreased (F<sub>1 - 2</sub>=200; p<sub>1 - 2</sub>&lt;0.001), in patients without genetic predisposition to cancer(Group 3), the level of TAA did not change compared to the control (F<sub>1 - 3</sub>= 2.13; p<sub>1 - 3</sub>=0.15), CONCLUSIONS: Oxidative stress plays a critical role in tumorigenesis, and antioxidant/oxidant imbalance may contribute to the malignant transformation of normal tissue.

4,"Papillary thyroid cancer: medical management and follow-up. The incidence of epithelial derived thyroid cancer (papillary thyroid cancer [PTC] and follicular thyroid cancer, known collectively as differentiated thyroid cancer) is rising. About 80% of patients with thyroid cancer have PTC and are best treated with thyroid-ectomy and functional lymph node dissection, followed by radioiodine ablation or therapy and performance of a posttreatment whole-body scan, followed by thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression. One year after radioiodine administration, the use of sensitive thyroglobulin (Tg) assays can separate the vast majority of patients with persistent disease from those who are free of disease and unlikely to have recurrent disease all without the need for repeat whole-body radioiodine imaging. Patients with detectable serum Tg during TSH suppression (Tg-on) or Tg that rises above 2 ng/mL after TSH stimulation (TSH-Tg) are highly likely to harbor residual tumor. TSH stimulation can be achieved using either thyroid hormone withdrawal or recombinant human TSH (rhTSH). Highly skilled screening neck ultrasonography can identify a few additional patients with subcentimeter residual neck lymph node metastases not detected by TSH-Tg. However, ultrasonography and chest computed tomography (CT) are most critical for tumor localization in those patients with Tg values that suggest residual disease or in those patients with persistent antithyroglobulin antibodies (TgAb) that falsely lower Tg measurement. TgAb quantitative titers typically resolve steadily over just a few years in patients free of disease after initial therapy. Another paradigm shift is the recognition that most patients who eventually achieve freedom from disease do so by surgery with fewer patients cured by repetitive radioiodine treatments, and even fewer cured with external beam radiation. Patients who appear to be free of disease require a lifetime of follow-up to optimize levothyroxine treatment, and they will undergo periodic stimulation testing because some will still manifest recurrent disease. Patients with persistent disease despite negative ultrasonography, chest CT, and whole-body radioiodine imaging may have a tumor identified by fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography, optimally performed with combined TSH stimulation and image fusion with CT or magnetic resonance imaging. Patients with metastatic disease who are unresponsive to conventional treatment are encouraged to participate in increasingly available thyroid cancer-specific clinical trials using targeted experimental oral or intravenous chemotherapeutic agents to address this tumor that has historically proven resistant to conventional chemotherapeutic agents."

4,"Implication from thyroid function decreasing during chemotherapy in breast cancer patients: chemosensitization role of triiodothyronine Thyroid hormones have been shown to regulate breast cancer cells growth, the absence or reduction of thyroid hormones in cells could provoke a proliferation arrest in G0-G1 or weak mitochondrial activity, which makes cells insensitive to therapies for cancers through transforming into low metabolism status. This biological phenomenon may help explain why treatment efficacy and prognosis vary among breast cancer patients having hypothyroid, hyperthyroid and normal function. Nevertheless, the abnormal thyroid function in breast cancer patients has been considered being mainly caused by thyroid diseases, few studied influence of chemotherapy on thyroid function and whether its alteration during chemotherapy can influence the respose to chemotherapy is still unclear. So, we aimed to find the alterations of thyroid function and non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS) prevalence druing chemotherapy in breast cancer patients, and investigate the influence of thyroid hormones on chemotherapeutic efficacy. Thyroid hormones and NTIS prevalence at initial diagnosis and during chemotherapy were analyzed in 685 breast diseases patients (369 breast cancer, 316 breast benign lesions). The influence of thyroid hormones on chemotherapeutic efficacy was evaluated by chemosensitization test, to compare chemotherapeutic efficacy between breast cancer cells with chemotherapeutics plus triiodothyronine (T3) and chemotherapeutics only. In breast cancer, NTIS prevalence at the initial diagnosis was higher and increased during chemotherapy, but declined before the next chemotherapeutic course. Thyroid hormones decreased signigicantly during chemotherapy. T3 can enhance the chemosensitivity of MCF-7 to 5-Fu and taxol, with progression from G0-G1 phase to S phase. The similar chemosensitization role of T3 were found in MDA-MB-231. We compared chemotherapeutic efficacy among groups with different usage modes of T3, finding pretreatment with lower dose of T3, using higher dose of T3 together with 5-Fu or during chemotherapy with 5-Fu were all available to achieve chemosensitization, but pretreatment with lower dose of T3 until the end of chemotherapy may be a safer and more efficient therapy. Taken together, thyroid hormones decreasing during chemotherapy was found in lots of breast cancer patients. On the other hand, thyroid hormones can enhance the chemotherapeutic efficacy through gatherring tumor cells in actively proliferating stage, which may provide a new adjuvant therapy for breast cancer in furture, especially for those have hypothyroidism during chemotherapy."
4,"Thyroid cancer among patients with thyroid nodules in Yemen: a three-year retrospective study in a tertiary center and a specialty clinic. The prevalence of thyroid cancer is increasing worldwide. No previous data are available on the prevalence of thyroid cancer in Yemen. We performed this study to determine the prevalence of thyroid cancer among patients with thyroid nodules in Yemen. A retrospective chart review was performed for 550 patients with thyroid nodules who underwent fine needle aspiration and/or thyroid surgery at a private endocrine clinic and at an endocrine clinic in a tertiary hospital in Yemen over a 3 -year period from October 2016–2019. The prevalence of thyroid cancer; the sonographic findings, Bethesda classification, age, sex, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels of the patients; and the nodule size and number were reviewed. A total of 550 charts were reviewed [501 females (91.1%) and 49 males (8.9%)]. The thyroid cancer prevalence among the patients was 13.8% (CI = 10.9–16.7), and the mean age of the patients was 38.5 years (SD = 12.2). The TSH level and the rate of cancer were significantly related (P = 0.01), but no significant difference in the prevalence of thyroid cancer was found between females (13.4%) and males (18.4%) (P = 0.334). When correlating the rate of cancer with the ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (UG-FNA) result, those with Bethesda system category III and IV, V and VI had malignancy rates of 20.8, 27.2, 52.4 and 69.2%, respectively. Thyroid nodules highly suspicious for malignancy on ultrasound had a 70% cancer diagnosis rate. The most common thyroid cancer was papillary cancer (71%), followed by follicular cancer (23.7%). Among those undergoing surgery, 44.2% had thyroid cancer, and 5.2% had a premalignant diagnosis. Thyroid cancer has a higher prevalence in Yemen than in other middle eastern countries. Our study also reports a higher rate of follicular thyroid cancer than that in other published data, which has to be confirmed by further studies. The malignancy and premalignant diagnosis rate was ~ 50% in our patients who underwent surgery. Many centers in Yemen still do not perform FNA before thyroid surgery. It is important that other centers in the country start emphasizing the need for FNA before surgery. This will decrease the number of unnecessary surgeries and associated complications."
4,"Optimizing surgical outcomes in papillary thyroid carcinoma with Hashimoto's Thyroiditis: a retrospective comparative study of unilateral and total thyroidectomy. The management of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) concurrent with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) lacks standardized guidelines, especially concerning surgical strategies. This study aimed to compare unilateral thyroidectomy (UT) with total thyroidectomy (TT) in PTC-HT patients to optimize clinical management and improve postoperative outcomes. This retrospective study included PTC-HT patients undergoing thyroid surgery at a tertiary academic medical institution from January 2018 to August 2023. The patients were grouped according to the quartiles of preoperative thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAB) levels at the last follow-up. Additionally, patients were divided into UT and TT groups, with propensity score matching (PSM) to ensure comparability. Patients were also stratified by TPOAB levels (L: 100-400, M: 400-1000, H: >1000). Patient-reported outcomes (PROMs), including quality of life and fatigue, were compared between UT and TT groups within each TPOAB subgroup (ΔPROMs = UT-TT). 246 patients were included. Those with higher TPOAB levels at the last follow-up reported increased physical fatigue scores. After PSM, there were no significant demographic differences between UT and TT groups. During a median follow-up of 16 months for UT and 20 months for TT, no recurrence or metastasis occurred. Compared to the UT group, the TT group exhibited lower TPOAB levels at the last follow-up (65.7 ± 78 vs. 374.6 ± 331.9, p < 0.001), and lower physical fatigue scores (3.6 ± 2.5 vs. 4.5 ± 2.8, p = 0.039). However, TT was associated with a higher incidence of transient hypoparathyroidism (7.8% vs. 1.1%, p = 0.030). Stratified analysis by preoperative TPOAB levels revealed significant differences in ΔPROMs (Physical fatigue) between L and H groups (0.2 ± 3.5 vs. 4.6 ± 2, p = 0.004) and between M and H groups (0.6 ± 4.5 vs. 4.6 ± 2, p = 0.037). ΔPROMs (Mental fatigue) also significantly differed between L and H groups (0 ± 1.8 vs. 1.6 ± 0.9, p = 0.026). For PTC-HT patients, particularly those with high preoperative TPOAB levels, TT offers advantages in alleviating fatigue symptoms but carries a higher risk of complications. Therefore, clinical decision-making should consider patient-specific factors, particularly preoperative TPOAB levels, to determine the optimal surgical approach.Trial registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry.

Thyroid epithelial and cancer cell lines were cultured in vitro. Western blotting and quantitative PCR were used to analyze protein and mRNA levels, respectively. Cell viability was measured by CCK-8 assay. Immunofluorescence staining indicated protein distribution in cell. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to study protein-protein interaction. Immunohistochemical staining was used to analyze protein expression in clinical tissues. Differences between groups were compared using the two-tailed Student's t test, and those among three or more groups were compared by one-way or two-way ANOVA.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">In the present study, HIP1R (Huntingtin Interacting Protein 1 Related) was found upregulated in thyroid cancer tissues and cell lines compared with that in the controls, while knockdown of HIP1R significantly inhibited the proliferation of thyroid cancer cells. Since HIP1R is essential for the clathrin-dependent endocytic process, we thereafter explored the effect of HIP1R on the endocytosis of thyroid cancer cells. Interestingly, knockdown of HIP1R significantly reduced the number of clathrin-coated pits (CCPs) in thyroid cancer cells. In addition, the interaction between HIP1R and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) was identified in thyroid cancer cells. Knockdown of HIP1R downregulated intracellular PTEN in thyroid cancer cells, but upregulated membrane-binding PTEN. Notably, flurbiprofen, a commonly used analgesic, significantly inhibited the proliferation of thyroid cancer cells and interfered with the interaction between HIP1R and PTEN, thereby enhancing the binding of PTEN to cell membrane. However, the proliferation inhibitory effect of flurbiprofen was attenuated when knocking down HIP1R or PTEN.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Upregulated HIP1R in thyroid cancer cells promotes cell proliferation and mediates the endocytosis of PTEN.

4,"Young people's perspectives of thyroid cancer screening and its harms after the nuclear accident in Fukushima Prefecture: a questionnaire survey indicating opt-out screening strategy of the thyroid examination as an ethical issue. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Overdiagnosis of thyroid cancer has become a major global medical issue. Ultrasound-based thyroid cancer screening has promoted overdiagnosis, and recently international recommendations state that it should not be conducted, even after a nuclear accident. The Fukushima thyroid cancer screening program was initiated in 2011 as a health policy after the nuclear accident. The risk of radiation-induced thyroid cancer was unlikely given the low radiation levels, but the thyroid cancer screening program has continued at 2-year intervals with a relatively high participation rate and is now in its fifth round. It is therefore crucial to clarify whether those targeted for screening understand the disadvantages of screening, and to identify factors that influenced their decision to participate.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We conducted an anonymous mail-based questionnaire among young people from Fukushima Prefecture (subjects) and a neighboring prefecture that was not targeted for screening (non-subjects).

4,"Clinical significance of prophylactic central compartment neck dissection in the treatment of clinically node-negative papillary thyroid cancer patients. Lymph nodal involvement is very common in differentiated thyroid cancer, and in addition, cervical lymph node micrometastases are observed in up to 80 % of papillary thyroid cancers. During the last decades, the role of routine central lymph node dissection (RCLD) in the treatment of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) has been an object of research, and it is now still controversial. Nevertheless, many scientific societies and referral authors have definitely stated that even if in expert hands, RCLD is not associated to higher morbidity; it should be indicated only in selected cases. In order to better analyze the current role of prophylactic neck dissection in the surgical treatment of papillary thyroid cancers, an analysis of the most recent literature data was performed. Prophylactic or therapeutic lymph node dissection, selective, lateral or central lymph node dissection, modified radical neck dissection, and papillary thyroid cancer were used by the authors as keywords performing a PubMed database research. Literature reviews, PTCs large clinical series and the most recent guidelines of different referral endocrine societies, inhering neck dissection for papillary thyroid cancers, were also specifically evaluated. A higher PTC incidence was nowadays reported in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) clinical series. In addition, ultrasound guided fine-needle aspiration citology allowed a more precocious diagnosis in the early phases of disease. The role of prophylactic neck dissection in papillary thyroid cancer management remains controversial especially regarding indications, approach, and surgical extension. Even if morbidity rates seem to be similar to those reported after total thyroidectomy alone, RCLD impact on local recurrence and long-term survival is still a matter of research. Nevertheless, only a selective use in high-risk cases is supported by more and more scientific data. In the last years, higher papillary thyroid cancer incidence and more precocious diagnoses were worldwide reported. Among endocrine and neck surgeons, there is agreement about indications to prophylactic treatment of node-negative “high-risk” patients. A recent trend toward RCLD avoiding radioactive treatment is still debated, but nevertheless, prophylactic dissections in low-risk cases should be avoided. Prospective randomized trials are needed to evaluate the benefits of different approaches and allow to drawn definitive conclusions."

This study aimed to investigate the potential causal effects of MDD, SCZ, BD, and thyroid cancer.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">We used publicly available summary statistics from large-scale genome-wide association studies to select genetic variant loci associated with MDD, SCZ, BD, and thyroid cancer as instrumental variables (IVs), which were quality controlled and clustered. Additionally, we used three Mendelian randomization (MR) methods, inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR-Egger regression and weighted median estimator (WME) methods, to estimate the bidirectional causal relationship between psychiatric disorders and thyroid cancer. In addition, we performed heterogeneity and multivariate tests to verify the validity of the IVs.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We used two-sample bidirectional MR analysis to determine whether there was a positive causal association between MDD and thyroid cancer risk. The results of the IVW analysis (OR = 3.956 95% CI = 1.177-13.299; P = 0.026) and the WME method (OR = 5.563 95% CI = 0.998-31.008; P = 0.050) confirmed that MDD may increase the risk of thyroid cancer. Additionally, our study revealed a correlation between genetic susceptibility to SCZ and thyroid cancer (OR = 1.532 95% CI = 1.123-2.088; P = 0.007). The results of the WME method analysis based on the median estimate (OR = 1.599 95% CI = 1.014-2.521; P = 0.043) also suggested that SCZ may increase the risk of thyroid cancer. Furthermore, our study did not find a causal relationship between BD and thyroid cancer incidence.

4,"A Novel Surgical Technique for Thyroid Cancer with Intra-Cricotracheal Invasion: Windmill Resection and Tetris Reconstruction The most effective treatment for thyroid cancer (TC) invading into the larynx and trachea is a complete surgical resection of the tumor, but currently employed techniques are less than ideal. We report a novel surgical technique, which we named Windmill resection and Tetris reconstruction, for patients with TC invading into the laryngeal lumen. We treated eight cases of TC with invasion into the laryngeal lumen by Windmill resection and Tetris reconstruction. We analyzed complications, clinical data, and pathological findings for all patients. Patients included one man and seven women (mean age 69 ± 10 years). Histopathology of TC indicated papillary cancer in five patients, poorly differentiated cancer in one patient, anaplastic cancer in one patient, and squamous cell carcinoma in one patient. Unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy was confirmed preoperatively by laryngoscope in four patients, and none had bilateral RLN palsy. All patients underwent Windmill resection and Tetris reconstruction along with total thyroidectomy (three patients), subtotal thyroidectomy (three patients), and lobectomy (two patients). Neck dissection was performed in all patients. The average resected length of the larynx and trachea was 29 ± 6 mm. Air leakage at the suture line occurred in three patients; two required further surgery, while the third was closed by insertion of a Penrose drain. Postoperative RLN palsy occurred in five patients. Aspiration was observed in two patients and resolved within 4 weeks. Pneumonia, atelectasis, and pleural effusion occurred in some patients. No other complications, including hemorrhage, wound infection, or airway stenosis, occurred. There was no postoperative mortality and no recurrence at the anastomotic site. Two patients underwent permanent tracheostomy due to permanent bilateral RLN palsy. Two patients, one with anaplastic cancer and the other with poorly differentiated cancer, recurred 13 and 21 months after surgery, while patients with papillary thyroid cancer had no local recurrence. Importantly, laryngeal functions such as phonation and swallowing were preserved in all patients. This novel surgical technique may be as effective as window resection of the larynx for local control of TC and contributes to the quality of life of patients by resulting in a less unsightly surgical wound."

4,"Thyroid cancer surgery. The surgical management of thyroid cancer is complex, controversial, and categorized by divergent opinions based upon retrospective, self-fulfilling data. This chapter will review the role of the surgeon in the evaluation of thyroid nodules and the management of malignant thyroid disease. Patients who ultimately prove to have thyroid cancer generally present with 1) a thyroid nodule with or without preoperative cytologic evidence of malignancy, 2) a rapidly enlarging neck mass with or without symptoms and signs associated with local invasion, or 3) a positive history of familial thyroid cancer with or without a positive calcitonin stimulation test, or more likely, a positive RET protooncogene screening examination for medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. The initial surgical evaluation is focused on evaluating risk factors. A history of head or neck irradiation in childhood or a familial history of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid significantly impact surgical management. The physical examination needs to focus on evidence of local invasion, fixation to surrounding structures, recurrent laryngeal nerve involvement, regional nodal metastases, and systemic disease. In addition, it is the surgeon’s obligation to screen for nonthyroidal disease that could impact perioperative management. This includes a history of bleeding disorders, cardiac, pulmonary, hepatic or renal disease, a potentially difficult airway, as well as potential endocrinopathies including thyrotoxicosis, Addisonian crisis and pheochromocytoma. It is also important to perform a laryngeal examination in every surgical candidate to evaluate recurrent laryngeal nerve integrity by the demonstration of vocal cord function. Surgery is an important, but not the only essential component in the management of patients with thyroid cancer. It is a requisite that each surgeon who manages these patients has an integrated plan that operates in concert with cytopathologists, endocrinologists, and radiation oncologists. The sensitivity and specificity of fine needle aspiration (FNA) varies between institutions and even among individual cytopathologists. Since FNA is the single most important preoperative diagnostic procedure for the majority of patients with dominant thyroid nodules, every thyroid surgeon must be able to evaluate the reliability and accuracy of the FNA findings upon which critical clinical decisions are based."
4,"Restricting ultrasound thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy by nodule size: which tumors are we missing? A population-based study Clinicians use nodule size to determine which thyroid nodules should receive cytological evaluation. The American Thyroid Association (ATA) has recommended against cytological evaluation for nodules <1 cm. It is unknown, however, if nodule size can accurately discriminate lesions that will represent tumors with favorable versus unfavorable prognosis. Also, the characteristics of thyroid cancers that would not be diagnosed if a strict 1 cm size cut off is used as the threshold for biopsy of intrathyroidal nodules are not well established. Using the Rochester Epidemiology Project, a population-based cohort, we identified all thyroid nodules in Olmsted County residents from 2003-2006. To assess the presence of favorable or unfavorable features for each nodule size cutoff, each patient found to have thyroid cancer was risk-stratified using the ATA risk score, which predicts risk of recurrence and persistent disease. Thyroid cancer cases in which a biopsy was done for factors other than thyroid nodule size or suspicious ultrasound features were excluded. We identified 485 thyroid nodules, 46 (9.5%) harbored thyroid cancer. Of the 46 thyroid cancers, 37 (7.6%) had ATA low risk; 8 (1.6%) had intermediate, and only 1 (0.2%) had an ATA high risk scores. The frequency of thyroid cancer and the distribution of ATA risk scores were similar across tumor sizes. In thyroid nodules of <1 cm, 92 (87%) were benign, while 13 (13%) were malignant (11% ATA low risk, 2% ATA intermediate risk) without extrathyroid extension, aggressive histology, or distant metastasis. For all thyroid cancer patients, no cases of persistent disease were found after a median follow-up of 7 years. In this population-based study, we showed that high risk thyroid cancers are rare; indeed, in this highly selected cohort of patients, the ATA's recommendation to avoid cytologic evaluation in thyroid nodules less than 1 cm would not miss any thyroid cancer with high risk features. However, thyroid nodule size at presentation did not accurately discriminate between tumors with favorable versus unfavorable clinicopathologic features. Thus, if further discrimination is desired, for example, to avoid overdiagnosis, features other than size at presentation need to be evaluated."
4,"Demonstrating the undermining of science and health policy after the Fukushima nuclear accident by applying the Toolkit for detecting misused epidemiological methods. It is well known that science can be misused to hinder the resolution (i.e., the elimination and/or control) of a health problem. To recognize distorted and misapplied epidemiological science, a 33-item ""Toolkit for detecting misused epidemiological methods"" (hereinafter, the Toolkit) was published in 2021. Applying the Toolkit, we critically evaluated a review paper entitled, ""Lessons learned from Chernobyl and Fukushima on thyroid cancer screening and recommendations in the case of a future nuclear accident"" in Environment International in 2021, published by the SHAMISEN (Nuclear Emergency Situations - Improvement of Medical and Health Surveillance) international expert consortium. The article highlighted the claim that overdiagnosis of childhood thyroid cancers greatly increased the number of cases detected in ultrasound thyroid screening following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident. However, the reasons cited in the SHAMISEN review paper for overdiagnosis in mass screening lacked important information about the high incidence of thyroid cancers after the accident. The SHAMISEN review paper ignored published studies of screening results in unexposed areas, and included an invalid comparison of screenings among children with screenings among adults. The review omitted the actual state of screening in Fukushima after the nuclear accident, in which only nodules > 5 mm in diameter were examined. The growth rate of thyroid cancers was not slow, as emphasized in the SHAMISEN review paper; evidence shows that cancers detected in second-round screening grew to more than 5 mm in diameter over a 2-year period. The SHAMISEN consortium used an unfounded overdiagnosis hypothesis and misguided evidence to refute that the excess incidence of thyroid cancer was attributable to the nuclear accident, despite the findings of ongoing ultrasound screening for thyroid cancer in Fukushima and around Chernobyl. By our evaluation, the SHAMISEN review paper includes 20 of the 33 items in the Toolkit that demonstrate the misuse of epidemiology. The International Agency for Research on Cancer meeting in 2017 and its publication cited in the SHAMISEN review paper includes 12 of the 33 items in the Toolkit. Finally, we recommend a few enhancements to the Toolkit to increase its utility."
4,"Deltopectoral flap revisited for reconstruction surgery in patients with advanced thyroid cancer: a case report We present the cases of 2 patients with invasive thyroid cancer, who underwent reconstructive surgery using a deltopectoral flap. Although the overall rate of extrathyroidal extension in patients with thyroid cancer is quite low, skin invasion is the most common pattern observed. Reconstructive surgery, involving local skin flaps, is required in these patients. The deltopectoral flap relies on the blood supply from intercostal perforators of the internal thoracic artery and usually requires skin grafting to the donor site. The internal thoracic artery is rarely sacrificed in these cases, even in an advanced surgery such as in patients with invasive thyroid cancer. A 55-year-old man with a distended thyroid gland presented to our hospital. He underwent advanced surgery, including skin excision, because we suspected that his tumor was thyroid cancer. The defect was covered with an ipsilateral deltopectoral flap via transposition of the flap, without skin grafting. In the second case, a 67-year-old woman with thyroid cancer that metastasized to her neck lymph nodes presented to our institution. Although the ipsilateral internal thoracic artery was sacrificed near its origin during tumor resection, the deltopectoral flap was raised in the usual manner without any complications. The skin defect caused by the tumor resection was covered with the flap. The patient had an uneventful clinical course for more than 2 years of follow-up. These 2 cases show the effectiveness of using the deltopectoral flap as a reconstructive option for patients with thyroid cancer who underwent radical surgery, resulting in a skin defect. The first case shows that this flap does not always require skin grafting to the donor site. To our knowledge, the second case may be the first report of a deltopectoral flap that was safely raised and applied with resection of the bifurcation of the ipsilateral internal thoracic artery. Although thyroid cancer surgery with surrounding skin excision is a rare procedure, we found that the deltopectoral flap was useful and should be the first choice for patients undergoing reconstructive surgery, whether the bifurcation of the ipsilateral internal thoracic artery is sacrificed."
4,"SoLAT (Sorafenib Lenvatinib alternating treatment): a new treatment protocol with alternating Sorafenib and Lenvatinib for refractory thyroid Cancer. In the last decade, several tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), which disrupt pathways involved in the proliferation and tumorigenesis of thyroid cancer, have been extensively studied. Two different TKIs, lenvatinib and sorafenib, were recently approved by both the US FDA and European Medicine Agency. Until date, the duration of the TKI response is not sufficient and resistance eventually occurs. The goal of this study was to investigate a new treatment protocol, SoLAT, using sorafenib and lenvatinib alternatively on refractory thyroid cancer. Patient-derived aggressive papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) cell lines from patients with biochemical and histologically proven aggressive RAI-refractory papillary thyroid cancer were exposed to sorafenib and lenvatinib alternatively. Human thyroid cancer cell xenografts were obtained by injecting patient-derived aggressive PTC cell lines into the flank of female BALB/c nude mice. Tumor-bearing mice were treated with sorafenib and lenvatinib alternatively. Cell viability assay, immunofluorescence analysis, confocal imaging, immunoblot analysis, flow cytometry analysis of cell cycle and a tube formation assay were performed. SoLAT was more effective for advanced PTC cell lines than individual treatment. Immunoblot analysis showed that SoLAT markedly increased levels of cell cycle inhibitors (p53 and p21), and pro-apoptotic factors (Apaf-1 and cleaved caspase 3) and decreased levels of positive cell cycle regulators (cyclin D1, CDK4, CDK6) and anti-apoptotic factors (p-NFκB, Bcl-2). Increased sub-G0/G1 population was observed in the SoLAT group, leading to apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, and strong inhibition of advanced PTC cell viability. SoLAT reduced the level of EMT markers such as vimentin, E-cadherin, Snail and Zeb1 by FGFR inhibition. In the xenograft model, individual treatment with sorafenib or lenvatinib did not markedly suppress patient-derived aggressive PTC cell xenograft tumors, whereas SoLAT significantly suppressed the proliferation of these tumors. SoLAT was more effective than individual treatment with sorafenib or lenvatinib in inhibiting PTC progression by inducing cell cycle arrest. Studies using both in vitro cell culture and an in vivo xenograft model provided evidence of tumor shrinkage with SoLAT. We suggest that these effects may be due to reduced EMT-mediated drug resistance in the aggressive PTC model."
4,"Association between exposure to radioactive iodine after the Chernobyl accident and thyroid volume in Belarus 10-15 years later. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">While there is a robust literature on environmental exposure to iodine-131 (<sup>131</sup>I) in childhood and adolescence and the risk of thyroid cancer and benign nodules, little is known about its effects on thyroid volume.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">To assess the effect of <sup>131</sup>I dose to the thyroid on the volume of the thyroid gland, we examined the data from the baseline screening of the Belarusian-American Cohort Study of residents of Belarus who were exposed to the Chernobyl fallout at ages ≤18 years. Thyroid dose estimates were based on individual thyroid activity measurements made shortly after the accident and dosimetric data from questionnaires obtained 10-15 years later at baseline screening. During baseline screening, thyroid gland volume was assessed from thyroid ultrasound measurements. The association between radiation dose and thyroid volume was modeled using linear regression where radiation dose was expressed with power terms to address non-linearity. The model was adjusted for attained age, sex, and place of residence, and their modifying effects were examined.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The analysis was based on 10,703 subjects. We found a statistically significant positive association between radiation dose and thyroid volume (P &lt; 0.001). Heterogeneity of association was observed by attained age (P &lt; 0.001) with statistically significant association remaining only in the subgroup of ≥18 years at screening (P &lt; 0.001). For this group, increase in dose from 0.0005 to 0.15 Gy was associated with a 1.27 ml (95% CI: 0.46, 2.07) increase in thyroid volume.

4,"TRAIL-induced apoptosis of thyroid cancer cells: potential for therapeutic intervention. To determine whether the apoptotic machinery of thyroid cancer cells is functional and could be activated for tumoricidal purposes, we examined the apoptosis induced by the cytokines TNF-alpha, Fas and TRAIL in thyroid cancer cell lines, NPA and SW579. Interestingly, out of these cytokines, only TRAIL was able to trigger significant apoptosis. The tumoricidal effect of TRAIL was further enhanced by CHX, suggesting the presence of CHX-sensitive inhibitor(s) of apoptosis in these thyroid cancer cell lines. The anti-apoptotic proteins like FLAME-1, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL are believed to be such CHX-sensitive inhibitors in various types of cancer cells. We, however, provide the evidence using NPA and SW579 cell lines that these proteins were not affected by the CHX treatment in thyroid cancer cells. The apoptosis of thyroid cancer cells was mediated by the classical activation of caspases that in turn activated the DNA Fragmentation Factor (DFF-45). To elucidate the role of individual caspases in TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, the inhibitory effects of several general and specific tetrapeptide caspase inhibitors were studied. The inhibitors of caspase-1, -6, -8, and -9 as well as general upstream inhibitors of apoptosis could dramatically inhibit TRAIL-induced apoptosis in thyroid cancer cells. Caspase-2 and -3 inhibitors, on the other hand, had no significant effect. When the cells were treated with either agonistic Fas antibody (CH11) or TNF-alpha, no apoptotic changes were observed. The apoptosis induced by agonistic Fas Ab could be seen only after a prolonged exposure (24 h) to CHX, whereas TNF-alpha had no effect even in the presence of CHX. The efficacy of TRAIL was also tested on other types of thyroid cancer cells like ARO, FRO (anaplastic carcinoma) and TPC-1 (papillary carcinoma) and compared to that triggered by other death inducing cytokines FasL and TNF-alpha. Again TRAIL was more potent in triggering apoptosis than Fas and TNF-alpha. Since TRAIL is effective in selectively killing thyroid tumor cells without affecting normal thyrocytes and also does not cause organ toxicity and inflammation in vivo, its potential for the treatment of thyroid cancer seems very promising."
4,"Thyroid cancer: trends in incidence, mortality and clinical-pathological patterns in Zhejiang Province, Southeast China Thyroid cancer is the most common malignant disease of the endocrine system. Previous studies indicate a rapid increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer in recent decades, and this increase has aroused the great public concern. The aim of this study was to analyze the trends in incidence, mortality and clinical-pathological patterns of thyroid cancer in Zhejiang province. Population-based incidence and mortality rates of thyroid cancer were collected from eight cancer registries in Zhejiang from 2000 to 2012. The incidence and mortality rates were age-standardized to Segi’s world population. A Joinpoint model was used to examine secular trends in age-adjusted thyroid cancer rates with the Joinpoint Regression Program Version 4.0.0. Thyroid cancer patients were recruited from Zhejiang Cancer Hospital from 1972 to 2014. Patient demographics, tumor histology and tumor size were compared among the different periods of 1972–1985, 1986–1999 and 2000–2014. The age-standardized incidence rate of thyroid cancer in Zhejiang cancer registries was 2.75/105 in 2000, and increased to 19.42/105 in 2012. Additionally, we observed significantly increasing incidence rates with the Annual Percent Change (APC) of 22.86% (95%CI, 19.2%–26.7%). The age-standardized mortality of thyroid cancer in Zhejiang cancer registries was 0.23/105 in 2000 and 0.25/105 in 2012. No significant change in mortality rate was found. We observed a rapid increase in the proportions of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in 12,508 patients with thyroid carcinoma identified in the Zhejiang Cancer Hospital from 1972 to 2014 while the proportions of poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC), medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) decreased over the decades. In the PTC cases, the proportion of patients with maximum tumor diameter (MTD) < 1 cm dramatically and significantly increased from 0 in 1972–1985 to 32.1% in 2000–2014. A rapid increase in incidence and a stable trend in mortality of thyroid cancer were found in the distribution of thyroid cancer. Most of the increased incidence was PTC, especially the papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) with MTD < 1 cm. This increase in incidence might be due to increased diagnosis with advanced technology."
4,"Thyroid cancer overdiagnosis and overtreatment: a cross- sectional study at a thyroid cancer referral center in Ecuador. In contrast to the rapid increase in thyroid cancer incidence, the mortality has remained low and stable over the last decades. In Ecuador, however, thyroid cancer mortality has increased. The objective of this study is to determine possible drivers of high rates of thyroid cancer mortality, through a cross-sectional analysis of all patients attending a thyroid cancer referral center in Ecuador. From June 2014 to December 2017, a cross-sectional study was conducted at the Hospital de Especialidades Eugenio Espejo, a regional reference public hospital for endocrine neoplasia in adults in Quito, Ecuador. We identified the mechanism of detection, histopathology and treatment modalities from a patient interview and review of clinical records. Among 452 patients, 74.8% were young adults and 94.2% (426) were female. 13.7% had a family history of thyroid cancer, and patients’ median tumor size was 2 cm. The incidental finding was 54.2% whereas 45.8% was non-incidental. Thyroid cancer histology reported that 93.3% had papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), 2.7% follicular, 1.5% Hurtle cells, 1.6% medullary, 0.7% poor differentiated, and 0.2% anaplastic carcinoma. The mean MACIS (metastasis, age, completeness, invasion, and size) score was 4.95 (CI 4.15–5.95) with 76.2% of the thyroid cancer patients having MACIS score less than or equal to 6. The very low and low risk of recurrence was 18.1% (79) and 62% (271) respectively. An analysis of 319 patients with non-metastatic thyroid cancer showed that 10.7% (34) of patients had surgical complications. Moreover, around 62.5% (80 from 128 patients with thyroglobulin laboratory results) of TC patients had a stimulated-thyroglobulin value equal or higher than 2 ng/ml. Overall, a poor surgical outcome was present in 35.1% (112) patients. Out of 436 patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma, 86% (375) received radioactive iodine. Thyroid cancer histological characteristics and method of diagnosis are like those described in other reports without any evidence of the high frequency of aggressive thyroid cancer histology. However, we observed evidence of overtreatment and poor surgical outcomes that demand additional studies to understand their association with thyroid cancer mortality in Ecuador."
4,"Thyroid cancer epidemiology in England and Wales: time trends and geographical distribution. Thyroid cancer incidence has been increasing in many countries, whereas mortality has been falling due to better survival. Radiation is the best-established risk factor and there has been concern that recent rises in incidence might be related to fallout radiation from atmospheric nuclear weapon tests. We examined thyroid cancer time trends and geographical distribution in England and Wales and possible interpretations of these. During 1962-84, there were significant increases in incidence (P < 0.001) in each sex at ages under 45. Cohort analysis by single year of birth showed an overall increase in incidence risks in women aged 0-44 born since 1920, with a sudden rise in risk for the birth years 1952-55 followed by a lower risk for the more recent cohorts. In men, there was an overall increase in risk at ages 0-44 in successive birth cohorts, but the pattern was irregular. In each sex, the risk in persons aged 45 and over decreased slightly in successive generations. Geographically, highest incidence risks were in countries in North and Mid Wales, in which the risk was almost twice that in the rest of the country. This pattern was present only at ages 45 and over and was most clear in rural areas. The peak of thyroid cancer risk in women born in 1952-55 is consistent with a carcinogenic effect of fallout radiation, since these women were children in the late 1950s and early 1960s when fallout radiation was greatest in England and Wales. The focus of high thyroid cancer risks in Wales was in areas with high levels of fallout radiation. However, thyroid cancer risks in Wales were not high for more recent cohorts (the ones who were exposed to fallout early in life), and a focus on high risk of benign thyroid diseases was present in Wales well before nuclear weapons existed. The distributions of these benign thyroid diseases, or of factors causing them, seem more likely than fallout to explain the high risk areas for thyroid cancer in the country."

4,"Evaluating the Effectiveness of Triiodothyronine Suppression and Withdrawal Versus Thyrogen Injections in Thyroid Cancer Assessments. Objective This study aimed to evaluate the specificity and effectiveness of triiodothyronine (T3) suppression and withdrawal, as compared to the conventional diagnostic approach using Thyrogen recombinant thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) injections, in the assessment of thyroid cancer patients post-thyroidectomy. Methods In this retrospective study, 18 patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer at a tertiary care hospital (Mediclinic City Hospital) in Dubai were included. The patients underwent total thyroidectomy, iodine ablation, and neck ultrasound. The cohort's clinical characteristics were analyzed, and histopathological examination of thyroid nodules was performed. In this study, paired T-tests were applied to evaluate the before-and-after impact of T3 and Thyrogen treatments on TSH and thyroglobulin (TG) levels in individual patients. To further analyze the effectiveness of these treatments, independent T-tests were conducted, allowing for a comparison of TSH and TG levels between different treatment groups within the patient cohort. This approach provided a comprehensive assessment of the treatments' effects on key thyroid indicators. Additionally, the diagnostic accuracy of T3 withdrawal and Thyrogen post-test on TG levels was assessed using statistical measures including sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. Results The cohort had a mean age of 42.1 years and a female predominance. Distinct clinical profiles were observed across different thyroid cancer subtypes. Histopathological analysis confirmed typical features of papillary carcinoma variants. Significant changes in TSH levels post-treatment were noted, with T3 treatments showing a marked increase in TSH and TG levels, although changes in TG levels were not always statistically significant. Diagnostic test evaluation showed a sensitivity of 77.78%, a specificity of 83.33%, and an overall accuracy of 80.00% for T3 withdrawal and Thyrogen post-test on TG. Conclusion The study provides comprehensive insights into the clinical profiles and treatment responses in thyroid cancer patients post-thyroidectomy. The effectiveness of T3 and Thyrogen treatments in altering TSH and TG levels was established, with significant implications for patient management. The diagnostic tests for T3 withdrawal and Thyrogen post-test on TG demonstrated high accuracy, underlining their clinical utility in the post-treatment evaluation of thyroid cancer patients."

4,"Fyn and Lyn gene polymorphisms impact the risk of thyroid cancer. Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of the endocrine glands, and during last couple of decades, its incidence has risen alarmingly, across the globe. Etiology of thyroid cancer is still debatable. There are a few worth mentioning risk factors which contribute to initiation of abnormalities in thyroid gland leading to cancer. Genetic instability is major risk factors in thyroid carcinogenesis. Among the genetic factors, the Src family of genes (Src, Yes1, Fyn and Lyn) have been implicated in many cancers but there is little data regarding the association of these (Src, Yes1, Fyn and Lyn) genes with thyroid carcinogenesis. Fyn and Lyn genes of Src family found engaged in proliferation, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and metastasis in different cancers. This study was planned to examine the effect of Fyn and Lyn SNPs on thyroid cancer risk in Pakistani population in 500 patients and 500 controls. Three polymorphisms of Fyn gene (rs6916861, rs2182644 and rs12910) and three polymorphisms of Lyn gene (rs2668011, rs45587541 and rs45489500) were analyzed using Tetra-primer ARMS-PCR followed by DNA sequencing. SNP rs6916861 of Fyn gene mutant genotype (CC) showed statistically significant threefold increased risk of thyroid cancer (P < 0.0001). In case of rs2182644 of Fyn gene, mutant genotype (AA) indicated statistically significant 17-fold increased risk of thyroid cancer (P < 0.0001). Statistically significant threefold increased risk of thyroid cancer was observed in genotype AC (P < 0.0001) of Fyn gene polymorphism rs12910. In SNP rs2668011 of Lyn gene, TT genotype showed statistically significant threefold increased risk of thyroid cancer (P < 0.0001). In case of rs45587541 of Lyn gene, GA genotypes showed statistically significant 11-fold increased risk in thyroid cancer (P < 0.0001). Haplotype analysis revealed that AAATAG*, AGACAG*, AGCCAA*, AGCCAG*, CAATAG*, CGCCAG* and CGCCGA* haplotypes of Fyn and Lyn polymorphisms are associated with increased thyroid cancer risk. These results showed that genotypes and allele distribution of Fyn and Lyn are significantly linked with increased thyroid cancer risk and could be genetic adjuster for said disease."

Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay was carried out to verify the interaction of SBP1 with TXN. The mouse xenograft experiment was performed to investigate the growth of thyroid cancer cells with SBP1 knockdown in vivo.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">SBP1 was significantly increased in human thyroid cancer tissues and cells, especially in anaplastic thyroid cancer. Overexpression of SBP1 promoted FTC-133 cell proliferation, and the culture supernatant of SBP1-overexpression FTC-133 cells promoted tube formation of human retinal microvascular endothelial cells. Knockdown of SBP1, however, inhibited cell proliferation and tube formation. Furthermore, overexpression of SBP1 inhibited cellular differentiation of differentiated thyroid cancer cell line FTC-133, as indicated by decreased expression of thyroid stimulating hormone receptors, thyroglobulin and NIS. Knockdown of SBP1, however, promoted differentiation of BHT101 cells, an anaplastic thyroid cancer cell line. Notably, TXN, a negative regulator of NIS, was found to be significantly upregulated in human thyroid cancer tissues, and it was positively regulated by SBP1. Co-IP assay implied a direct interaction of SBP1 with TXN. Additionally, TXN overexpression reversed the effect of SBP1 knockdown on BHT101 cell viability, tube formation and cell differentiation. An in vivo study found that knockdown of SBP1 promoted the expression of thyroid stimulating hormone receptors, thyroglobulin and NIS, as well as inhibited the growth and progression of thyroid cancer tumors.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">SBP1 promoted tumorigenesis and dedifferentiation of thyroid cancer through positively regulating TXN.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2023.

4,"Evaluation of thyroid diseases and differentiated thyroid cancer in acromegalic patients Thyroid diseases are frequently seen in patients with acromegaly. The aim of this study is to evaluate thyroid diseases and thyroid cancer in acromegalic patients followed in a single institution. The data of 92 acromegalic (43 male, 49 female) patients followed over 12 years were retrieved retrospectively from the hospital recordings. All available data for gender, age, body weight and height, duration of acromegaly, age at diagnosis of acromegaly, treatment methods for acromegaly and history of thyroid disease, serum GH, IGF-1, thyroid function tests, thyroid ultrasonography (US), thyroid scintigraphy and thyroid fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) results were recorded for the patients. The mean age of the patients was 43.9 ± 10.8 years and the mean disease duration was 12 ± 6.9 years. Thyroid US was performed in 64 patients who had nodular or diffuse goiter on palpation during the post-treatment follow-up and nodules were found in 44 (47.8 %) patients. Final diagnosis in 64 patients with thyroid US results and thyroid function tests including 26 patients with FNAB were as follows: 31 (48.4 %) benign multinodular goiter (MNG), 6 (9.4 %) simple nodular goiter, 1 (1.6 %) toxic MNG, 1 (1.6 %) Hurthle cell adenoma, and 5 (7.8 %) differentiated thyroid cancer. In addition, 9 (14.1 %) patients had diffuse goiter. One of the patients with diffuse goiter had amiodarone induced thyrotoxicosis. Eleven (17.1 %) patients had normal thyroid US and no other thyroid disease. Patients with nodules had longer disease duration than patients without nodules (14.2 ± 6.6 vs. 9.4 ± 3.4 years, p = 0.043). Thyroid volume was positively correlated with post-treatment GH and post-treatment IGF-1 levels (r = 0.309, p = 0.041 and r = 0.423, p = 0.004), respectively. We found that 7.8 % of our acromegalic patients with thyroid US results were diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Therefore, acromegalic patients must be considered as a high risk group for the development of thyroid cancer and must be closely followed for thyroid nodules and tumors."
4,"Physical activity, diabetes, and risk of thyroid cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis Thyroid cancer incidence has been increasing more rapidly over time than the occurrence of cancers of other sites, and interest in potential adverse relations of diabetes and lack of physical activity to thyroid cancer risk is accumulating. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of published epidemiologic studies on the relations of physical activity and diabetes to thyroid cancer according to the Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Published studies were identified through a search in MEDLINE and EMBASE. Random-effects models were used to summarize thyroid cancer risk estimates comparing high versus low levels of physical activity, and separately, comparing individuals with diabetes versus those without diabetes. Meta-regression analyses were performed to evaluate potential effect modification by study design and thyroid cancer risk factors. Information was extracted from seven studies of physical activity and thyroid cancer and from six studies of diabetes and thyroid cancer. The number of individuals from studies on physical activity was 939,305 (yielding 2,250 incident thyroid cancer cases) and from studies on diabetes it was 960,840 (yielding 1,230 cases). The summary relative risk (RR) estimate from cohort and case–control studies combined indicated no association between physical activity and thyroid cancer (summary RR 1.06, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.79–1.42). Subgroup-analyses revealed a significant positive association between physical activity and thyroid cancer in cohort studies (summary RR 1.28; 95 % CI 1.01–1.63), whereas the relation was suggestively inverse in case–control studies (summary RR 0.70; 95 % CI 0.48–1.03; p for heterogeneity = 0.005). Individuals with diabetes showed a borderline statistically significant increased risk of thyroid cancer compared with those without diabetes (summary RR 1.17; 95 % CI 0.99–1.39). The relations of physical activity and diabetes to thyroid cancer were not modified by sex, number of adjustment factors, and adjustments for adiposity, smoking, and study quality. In this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis, no significant association between physical activity and thyroid cancer was found. Diabetes showed a suggestive positive relation with risk of thyroid cancer."
4,"Expression of the NEK family in normal and cancer tissue: an immunohistochemical study. The NEK serine/threonine protein kinases are involved in cell cycle checkpoints, DNA damage repair, and apoptosis. Alterations in these pathways are frequently associated with cell malignant cellular transformations. Thyroid cancer is the most common malignant tumour in the endocrine system. Despite good treatment methods, the number of cases has increased significantly in recent years. Here, we studied the expression of NEK1, NEK2, NEK3, and NEK5 in different types of normal and malignant tissues, using tissue microarray analysis, and identified NEKs as potential markers in thyroid malignancy. The studied cases comprised multiple cancer tissue microarrays, including breast, colon, esophagus, kidney, lung, pancreas, prostate, stomach, thyroid and uterine cervix, as well as 281 patients who underwent thyroid resection for thyroid cancer or thyroid nodules. The expression of NEK1, NEK2, NEK3, and NEK5 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The expression pattern was evaluated in terms of intensity by two methods, semiquantitative and quantitative, and was compared between normal and cancer tissue. We analysed the expression of each member of the NEK family in a tissue-dependent manner. Compared to normal tissue, most of the evaluated proteins showed lower expression in lung tumour. However, in the thyroid, the expression was higher in malignant tissue, especially for NEK 1, NEK3 and NEK5. Concerning characteristics of the thyroid tumour, such as aggressiveness, NEK1 expression was higher in tumours with multifocality and in patients with lymph node metastasis. NEK3 expression was stronger in patients with stage II, that involved metastasis. NEK5, on the other hand, showed high expression in patients with invasion and metastasis and in patients with tumour size > 4 cm. Furthermore, this work, demonstrated for the first time a high specificity and sensitivity of over-expression of NEK1 in classical and follicular variants of papillary thyroid cancer and NEK3 in tall-cell papillary thyroid cancer. Taken together, the NEK protein kinases emerge as important proteins in thyroid cancer development and may help to identify malignancy and aggressiveness features during diagnosis.

4,"Breast cancer metastases to the thyroid gland - an uncommon sentinel for diffuse metastatic disease: a case report and review of the literature. Metastases to the thyroid are rare. The most common primary cancer to metastasize to the thyroid is renal cell carcinoma, followed by malignancies of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and skin, with breast cancer metastases to the thyroid being rare. Overall, the outcomes in malignancies that have metastasized to the thyroid are poor. There are no prospective studies addressing the role of surgery in metastatic disease of the thyroid. Isolated thyroidectomy has been proposed as a local disease control option to palliate and prevent the potential morbidity of tumor extension related to the airway. Here, we present a case of a patient with breast cancer metastases to the thyroid gland and discuss the role of thyroidectomy in the context of the current literature. A 62-year-old Afro-Caribbean woman was diagnosed as having bilateral breast carcinoma in 2004, for which she underwent bilateral mastectomy. The pathology revealed multifocal disease on the right, T2N0(0/20)M0 grade 1 and 2 invasive ductal carcinoma, and on the left side, T3N1(2/18)M0 grade 1 invasive ductal carcinoma. Surgery was followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and regional radiotherapy. The disease was under control on hormonal therapy until 2016, when she developed cervical lymphadenopathy. The fine-needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid was reported as papillary thyroid cancer; and the fine-needle biopsy of the left lateral nodal disease was more suggestive of breast malignancy. She underwent a total thyroidectomy and a clearance of the central compartment lymph nodes and a biopsy of the lateral nodal disease. The histopathological analysis was consistent with metastatic breast cancer in the thyroid and lymph nodes with no evidence of a primary thyroid malignancy. A past history of a malignancy elsewhere should raise the index of suspicion of metastatic disease in patients presenting with thyroid lumps with or without cervical lymphadenopathy. Detection of metastases to the thyroid generally indicates poor prognosis, obviating the need of surgery in an already compromised patient. An empirical thyroidectomy should be considered in select patients for local disease control."
4,"Epidemiological evidence for a link between postpartum thyroiditis and thyroid cancer. Key words: Case–control study, Kuwait, Postpartum thyroiditis, Thyroid cancerThyroid cancer and the large majority of benignthyroid disorders (e.g., Graves disease, nodule/adenoma, goitre, thyroiditis) occur 3–5 times morefrequently among women, and this female predomi-nance, which is greatest during reproductive ages, isobserved in all geographic areas and ethnic groups.Thyroid cancer is a relatively rare form of cancer and,in most countries, it accounts for approximately 1–6% of all cancers in females and<2% in males [1].Since the establishment of population-based cancerregistry in the late 1970s, thyroid cancer has consis-tently been the second most commonly recordedneoplasm (after breast) among Kuwaiti women.During the period 1997–2001, it accounted for 9.0%of all cancers among Kuwaiti women. Similarly highrelative frequency and incidence rates of the diseaseamong women have also been reported from severalother countries in the Gulf region (Oman, Qatar,Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates). It isnoteworthy that these countries also have high birthand total fertility rates (about 5–6 children/woman).Other reproductive health patterns in these countriesinclude high prevalence of consanguinity, youngage at marriage and childbearing, short birth inter-vals, and older ages at last birth [2]. All these factorsresult in a relatively long and eventful reproductivelife.Within this setting, we conducted a population-based case–control study among 238 women withthyroid cancer and a similar number of individuallymatched controls in Kuwait [3]. Among the repro-ductive factors, we found that women who hadexperienced episodes of postpartum thyroiditis (18cases, 2 controls) were at a signiﬁcantly increased riskof developing thyroid cancer (odds ratio: 10.2; 95%CI: 2.3–44.8); and the women who had experiencedthe condition had no previous thyroid disease orX-ray exposure to the neck. Although the relativelysmall number of exposed women does not allow us toconduct multivariable analysis, this unexpected ﬁnd-ing prompted us to look further into the character-istics of these women. Table 1 presents a descriptionof selected demographic and reproductive factorsamong the 18 women with thyroid cancer (17 papil-lary and 1 follicular carcinoma) and 2 controls whohad experienced episodes of postpartum thyroiditis.Compared with the other women with thyroid cancer(n"
4,"The diagnostic value of a new ultrasonographic method for the measurement of a taller-than-wide shape of benign and malignant thyroid nodules. <AbstractText Label=""PURPOSE"">To evaluate the diagnostic value of a new ultrasonographic method in the measurement of thyroid nodules with a taller-than-wide (TTW) shape.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">A total of 982 thyroid nodules were analysed, 571 of which were malignant thyroid nodules and 411 of which were benign nodules. Nodules were divided into two groups by size: Group A (&lt;1 cm, n = 627) and Group B (≥1 cm, n = 355). The angle between the maximum diameter of each nodule and the horizontal axis was measured by image analysis software. The best cut-off value for distinguishing between benign and malignant thyroid nodules and the diagnostic accuracy of the new ultrasonographic method in the measurement of TTW shapes were determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">The cut-off value for distinguishing benign and malignant thyroid nodules was 44.5 degrees. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.849 (95% CI: 0.822~0.875), and the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis of malignant thyroid nodules were 86.9% and 84.4%, respectively. Regarding the angle between the maximum diameter and the transverse axis of the thyroid nodules, an angle greater than 45 degrees was a significant indicator of a diagnosis of malignant thyroid nodules. The AUC for distinguishing malignant from benign thyroid nodules with the new ultrasonographic method in the measurement of TTW shapes was higher than that with the first method (FM) in the whole group, Group A and Group B (respectively, 0.849 vs. 0.812, 0.853 vs. 0.808, 0.852 vs. 0.828). The diagnostic sensitivity of a TTW shape measured by the new ultrasonographic method for predicting thyroid malignancy was significantly higher than that measured by the FM in the whole group, Group A and Group B (respectively, 0.858 vs. 0.760, 0.764 vs. 0.669, 0.890 vs. 0.815).</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">A TTW shape measured by our new ultrasonographic method showed superior performance for predicting thyroid malignancy.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2023.

4,"Adolescents with thyroid nodules: retrospective analysis of factors predicting malignancy Thyroid nodules are less common in children than in adults. However, pediatric thyroid nodules have a higher rate of malignancy compared to those in adults, and increased risk of metastasis and recurrence. In the present study, we analyzed the clinical features as well as laboratory and thyroid ultrasound (US) findings of children and adolescents with thyroid nodules to identify predictive factors of thyroid cancer. We retrospectively analyzed 275 patients with thyroid nodules under 18 years of age who visited Severance Children's Hospital between January 2005 and May 2017. Among them, 141 patients who underwent ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB), and four patients without FNAB who underwent surgical resection, were included in this study. The remaining 125 patients without FNAB and five patients with follow-up loss after FNAB were excluded. Clinical, laboratory, and US data were evaluated in 145 patients to establish the potential predictive factors of thyroid cancer. Thyroid malignancies were observed in 101 patients. Grade 2 goiters were seen more often in benign nodule group. Hypoechoic nodules, nodules with microcalcifications, abnormal lymph nodes, and irregular margins were findings significantly associated with thyroid cancer. The findings of hypoechoic nodule, nodule with microcalcifications, and abnormal lymph nodes showed statistical significance in predicting thyroid cancer.Conclusion: Hypoechoic nodules, nodules with microcalcifications, and abnormal lymph nodes are predictive factors for thyroid cancer in children. Therefore, further diagnostic evaluations, including FNAB, should be considered in patients with such findings.What is Known:• Thyroid nodules are less common in children than in adults, but pediatric thyroid nodules have a higher rate of malignancy, and also have increased risk of metastasis and recurrence.• Research on ways to predict thyroid cancer have mostly been accomplished in adult patients, and the application of risk stratification system has not been fully satisfactory in children, which requires further studies in pediatric thyroid nodules.What is New:• Hypoechoic nodules, nodules with microcalcifications, and abnormal lymph nodes are predictive factors for thyroid cancer in Korean children."
4,"Association between CTLA-4 + 49A > G and – 318C > T single-nucleotide polymorphisms and susceptibility to thyroid neoplasm Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4 or CD152) is among the immune checkpoint molecules and its abnormal expression in cancer predisposed individuals might make the person more susceptible to tumor initiation and progression. Considering the implication of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in CTLA-4 gene expression and probably protein function, one can assume the involvement of these SNPs in neoplastic diseases. rs5742909 ( − 318C > T) and rs231775 ( + 49 A > G) are among the most commonly studied SNPs and have been considered as genetic factors related to thyroid diseases. In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to elucidate the association between these SNPs and susceptibility to various types of thyroid cancers. We investigated the genetic polymorphisms of − 318C > T and + 49 A > G in the CTLA-4 gene by means of ARMS-PCR and RFLP-PCR, respectively, in 167 patients with thyroid carcinomas (papillary, follicular, and anaplastic). The results were then compared with a group of 100 age-sex matched healthy individuals. A statistically significant association was observed between the presence of G allele in + 49 A > G locus and thyroid carcinoma, when comparing cases and controls (OR = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.35–3.28; P = 0.001) and the frequency of heterozygotes (AG) was higher than homozygotes for allele A (AA), in patients with and papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). Regarding Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, the frequencies of A allele and AA genotype in PTC patients were higher than Hashimoto patients with no history of cancer (OR = 4.67, 95% CI = 2.70–8.08, P   T. In this study, we observed that G allele in + 49 A > G and possibly lower expression of mutated CTLA-4 molecule, is associated with higher susceptibility to thyroid carcinoma. Although the G allele frequency was higher in thyroid cancer patients, when justified for the presence of lymphocytic thyroiditis, the presence of A allele seemed to increase the odds for PTC in patients with Hashimoto’s disease."
4,"Thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) is a novel tumor suppressor in thyroid cancer Background: Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, and many patients with metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC), and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) fail to respond to conventional therapies, resulting in morbidity and mortality. Additional therapeutic targets and treatment options are needed for these patients. We recently reported that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is highly expressed in ATC and confers an aggressive phenotype when overexpressed in DTC cells. Methods: Microarray analysis was used to identify downstream targets of PPARγ in ATC cells. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to assess thioredoxin interacting protein (TXNIP) expression in thyroid cancer cell lines and primary tumor specimens. Retroviral transduction was used to generate ATC cell lines that overexpress TXNIP, and assays that assess glucose uptake, viable cell proliferation, and invasion were used to characterize the in vitro properties of these cells. An orthotopic thyroid cancer mouse model was used to assess the effect of TXNIP overexpression in ATC cell lines in vivo. Results: Using microarray analysis, we show that TXNIP is highly upregulated when PPARγ is depleted from ATC cells. Using Western blot analysis and IHC, we show that DTC and ATC cells exhibit differential TXNIP expression patterns. DTC cell lines and patient tumors have high TXNIP expression in contrast to low or absent expression in ATC cell lines and tumors. Overexpression of TXNIP decreases the growth of HTh74 cells compared to vector controls and inhibits glucose uptake in the ATC cell lines HTh74 and T238. Importantly, TXNIP overexpression in T238 cells results in attenuated tumor growth and decreased metastasis in an orthotopic thyroid cancer mouse model. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that TXNIP functions as a tumor suppressor in thyroid cells, and its downregulation is likely important in the transition from differentiated to advanced thyroid cancer. These studies underscore the potential of TXNIP as a novel therapeutic target and prognostic indicator in advanced thyroid cancer."
4,"The association between S100A13 and HMGA1 in the modulation of thyroid cancer proliferation and invasion S100A13 and high mobility group A (HMGA1) are known;  to play essential roles in the carcinogenesis and progression of cancer. However, the correlation between S100A13 and HMGA1 during cancer progression is not yet well understood. In this study, we determined the effects of S100A13 on HMGA1 expression in thyroid cancer cells and examined the role of HMGA1 in thyroid cancer progression. Stable ectopic S100A13 expression TT cellular proliferation was evaluated by nude mice xenografts assays. The effect of lentivirus-mediated S100A13 knockdown on thyroid cancer cellular oncogenic properties were evaluated by MTT, colony formation assays and transwell assays in TPC1 and SW579 cells. The effect of siRNA-mediated HMGA1 knockdown on thyroid cancer cellular proliferation and invasion were evaluated by MTT, colony formation assays and transwell assays. The tissue microarray was performed to investigate the correlation between S100A13 and HMGA1 expression in tumor tissues. The ectopic expression of S100A13 could increase tumor growth in a TT cell xenograft mouse model. Moreover, lentivirus-mediated S100A13 knockdown led to the inhibition of cellular oncogenic properties in thyroid cancer cells, and HMGA1 was found to be involved in the effect of S100A13 on thyroid cancer growth and invasion. Furthermore, siRNA-mediated HMGA1 knockdown was proved to inhibit the growth of TPC1 cells and invasive abilities of SW579 cells. Clinically, it was revealed that both S100A13 and HMGA1 showed a higher expression levels in thyroid cancer cases compared with those in matched normal thyroid cases (P = 0.007 and P = 0.000); S100A13 and HMGA1 expressions were identified to be positively correlated (P = 0.004, R = 0.316) when analyzed regardless of thyroid cancer types. This is the first report for the association between HMGA1 and S100A13 expression in the modulation of thyroid cancer growth and invasion. Those results would provide an essential insight into the effect of S100A13 on carcinogenesis of thyroid tumor, rending S100A13 to be potential biological marker for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer."
4,"Search for NTRK1 proto-oncogene rearrangements in human thyroid tumours originated after therapeutic radiation Rearrangements of NTRK1 proto-oncogene were detected in 'spontaneous' papillary thyroid carcinomas with a frequency varying from 5 to 25% in different studies. These rearrangements result in the formation of chimaeric genes composed of the tyrosine kinase domain of NTRK1 fused to 5' sequences of different genes. To investigate if the NTRK1 gene plays a role in radiation-induced thyroid carcinogenesis, we looked for the presence of NTRK1-activating rearrangements in 32 human thyroid tumours (16 follicular adenomas, 14 papillary carcinomas and two lymph-node metastases of papillary thyroid carcinomas) from patients who had received external radiation, using the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, Southern blot and direct sequencing techniques. These data were compared with those obtained in a series of 28 'spontaneous' benign and malignant thyroid tumours, collected from patients without a history of radiation exposure and four in vitro culture cell lines derived from 'spontaneous' thyroid cancers. Our results concerning the radiation-associated tumours showed that only rearrangements between NTRK1 and TPM3 genes (TRK oncogene) were detected in 2/14 papillary carcinomas and in one lymph-node metastasis of one of these papillary thyroid carcinomas. All the radiation-associated adenomas were negative. In the 'spontaneous' tumours, only one of the 14 papillary carcinomas and one of the four in vitro culture cell lines, derived from a papillary carcinoma, presented a NTRK1 rearrangement also with the TPM3 gene. Twenty-five of this series of radiation-associated tumours were previously studied for the ras and RET/PTC oncogenes. In conclusion, our data: (a) show that the overall frequency of NTRK1 rearrangements is similar between radiation-associated (2/31: 6%) and 'spontaneous' epithelial thyroid tumours (2/32: 6%). The frequency, if we consider exclusively the papillary carcinomas, is in both cases 12%; (b) show that the TRK oncogene plays a role in the development of a minority of radiation-associated papillary thyroid carcinomas but not in adenomas; and (c) confirm that RET/PTC rearrangements are the major genetic alteration associated with ionizing radiation-induced thyroid tumorigenesis."
4,"Performance of claims-based algorithms for identifying incident thyroid cancer in commercial health plan enrollees receiving antidiabetic drug therapies Abstract Background Thyroid cancer incidence is increasing in the United States (US) and many other countries. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate algorithms using administrative medical claims data for identification of incident thyroid cancer. Methods This effort was part of a prospective cohort study of adults initiating therapy on antidiabetic drugs and used administrative data from a large commercial health insurer in the US. Patients had at least 6 months of continuous enrollment prior to initiation during 2009–2013, with follow-up through March, 2014 or until disenrollment. Potential incident thyroid cancers were identified using International Classification of Diseases, 9 th Revision (ICD-9) diagnosis code 193 (malignant neoplasm of the thyroid gland). Medical records were adjudicated by a thyroid cancer specialist. Several clinical variables (e.g., hospitalization, treatments) were considered as predictors of case status. Positive predictive values (PPVs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the performance of two primary algorithms. Results Charts were requested for 170 patients, 150 (88%) were received and 141 (80%) had sufficient information to adjudicate. Of the 141 potential cases identified using ≥1 ICD-9 diagnosis code 193, 72 were confirmed as incident thyroid cancer (PPV of 51% (95% CI 43–60%)). Adding the requirement for thyroid surgery increased the PPV to 68% (95% CI 58-77%); including the presence of other therapies (chemotherapy, radio-iodine therapy) had no impact. When cases were required to have thyroid surgery during follow-up and ≥2 ICD-9 193 codes within 90 days of this surgery, the PPV was 91% (95% CI 81-96%); 62 (82%) of the true cases were identified and 63 (91%) of the non-cases were removed from consideration by the algorithm as potential cases. Conclusions These findings suggest a significant degree of misclassification results from relying only on ICD-9 diagnosis codes to detect thyroid cancer. An administrative claims-based algorithm was developed that performed well to identify true incident thyroid cancer cases."
4,"Mazabraud's syndrome and thyroid cancer, a very rare and confusing association: a case report. Mazabraud’s syndrome is defined as the association between fibrous dysplasia and intramuscular myxomas. The syndrome was first described in 1967 and, up until now, less than 100 cases have been reported worldwide. Here we report the association between this rare syndrome and thyroid cancer. When a malignant disease occurs in a patient affected by this syndrome, the differential diagnosis between benign and malignant bone lesions should be undertaken carefully. We report the case of a 57-year-old Caucasian male, admitted for diffuse bone pain localized in the left leg and for the presence of an indolent, slow-growing mass in the left shoulder. The patient also presented with a thyroid nodule, highly suggestive of a malignancy. The radiologic examination showed multiple osteolytic lesions. The suspicion of multiple myeloma or bone metastases arising from a thyroid cancer was considered. Electrophoresis of proteins was negative and therefore excluded the diagnosis of multiple myeloma; the thyroid surgery was indicated. Thyroidectomy confirmed the papillary thyroid carcinoma, and the bone lesions were considered to be metastases from the thyroid cancer. After surgery, under thyroid-stimulated hormonal conditions, the patient underwent radioiodine therapy and a post-therapy radioiodine whole body scan. The lack of radioiodine uptake, both in the bone lesions and shoulder mass, suggested the possibility of less differentiated, non-avid radioiodine lesions, or the absence of any relation between pathologies. Considering the low level of the specific tumor marker, thyroglobulin, a bone biopsy and resection of the shoulder mass were indicated. The final diagnosis was intramuscular myxoma with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia in the deltoid muscle (Mazabraud’s syndrome). A completely incidental cerebral tumor lesion was also discovered. During the evolution of a malignant disease, Mazabraud’s syndrome, known as the association of intramuscular myxoma with fibrous dysplasia, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of bone metastasis. This is the first report in the literature of Mazabraud’s syndrome occurring in a patient with thyroid cancer."

4,"Health-Related Quality of Life After Thyroid Cancer Surgery: A Single-Center, Cross-Sectional Study in Southern Vietnam. Background Thyroid cancer is the most common malignant disease in the endocrine glands. Symptoms of the disease affect the functions of organs in the body. Although thyroid cancer is often considered a ""good cancer"" because it progresses slowly, the likelihood of successful treatment is quite high; what is special is that the effect on the quality of life (QoL) is on par with more severe types of cancer. Currently, studies on QoL assessment in thyroid cancer patients are quite limited in southern Vietnam. The present study investigated the potential risk factors of deterioration in QoL scores in thyroid cancer patients after thyroidectomy. Methodology A descriptive, cross-sectional study was performed on a total of 162 patients who were diagnosed with thyroid cancer and underwent thyroidectomy at the University Medical Center Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, from February to May 2023. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews with patients and from medical records. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 was used to assess the QoL one month after thyroidectomy. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors related to QoL with statistical significance set at p-value <0.05. Results The mean overall QoL in thyroid cancer survivors was 84.4 ± 10.00 (on a scale of 0-100, where 100 was the best). The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the factors related to QoL after thyroidectomy were surgery type (p < 0.001), having a comorbidity (p = 0.029), economic status (p = 0.026), and hormone disorder (p = 0.009). Conclusions Our study indicated that surgery type, having a comorbidity, economic status, and hormone disorders were independent risk factors for decreased QoL one month after thyroidectomy. It is necessary to thoroughly assess the QoL before and after surgery in thyroid cancer patients. Longer follow-up QoL studies should be performed with larger sample sizes for more accurate results."
4,"Endpoints for screening thyroid cancer in the Republic of Korea: thyroid specialists’ perspectives Cancer screening is aimed primarily at reducing deaths from the specific cancer. Thyroid-specific cancer mortality may be the most ambitious endpoint for obtaining estimates of screening effect. Numerous observations have accumulated over the years, indicating that thyroid cancer mortality endpoint has been difficult to study and is confounded by population heterogeneity, provision of randomization, and requirement of large cohorts with sufficiently long follow-up due to the excellent prognosis of the cancer. Accordingly, it may be important to reconsider how to best measure thyroid cancer screening efficacy. Recommendations against thyroid cancer screening should be based upon trials designed to evaluate its effectiveness not only in significant reduction in cancer mortality, but also of other distinct endpoints. It is desirable to evaluate derivative endpoints that can reliably predict reductions in mortality. The term ""derivative"" means a variable that is related to the true endpoint and is likely to be observable before the primary endpoint. Derivative endpoints may include thyroid cancer incidence, the proportion of early-stage tumors detected, more treatable stage, the identification of small tumors (to maintain in observation), decrease in the number of people who develop metastatic disease, the increased chance of lesser extent surgery, and the application of minimally invasive approaches, as well as no need for lifelong thyroid replacement therapy, a consistent follow-up, low-dose or no RAI administration and risk factor assessments where case findings should be continuous. The Korean guidelines for thyroid cancer national-level screening were published by a relevant group of multidisciplinary thyroid experts. It was concluded that the evidence is insufficient to balance the benefits and harms of thyroid cancer screening. However, the paper seems to raise the necessary investments in future research and demand a complete analysis for derivative endpoints, and offer screening participants with complete information necessary to make decisions that will provide them with the most value when a small thyroid cancer is screen-identified."

Several studies found sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors may inhibit the growth of tumors. However, whether SGLT2 inhibitors have therapeutic effect on thyroid cancer remains unclear.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""MATERIALS AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">The levels of SGLT2 in PTC and normal thyroid tissue were assessed by immunohistochemistry and clinical dataset analysis. Cell growth was detected by the CCK-8 and colony formation. Glucose uptake into thyroid cancer cell was evaluated by 2-DG uptake assay. Glycolysis were analyzed by Seahorse XF Extracellular Flux Analysis. RNA-seq were used to screen differentially expressed genes of cells treated with/without canagliflozin (a SGLT2 inhibitor). Furthermore, flow cytometry, western blot, and gene set enrichment analysis were employed to elucidate cell cycle, apoptosis and the underlying mechanism of the anticancer effect of canagliflozin. The effect of canagliflozin on thyroid cancer growth was further confirmed in vivo through xenograft formation assay.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">SGLT2 inhibition attenuated the growth of thyroid cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Canagliflozin inhibited glucose uptake, glycolysis and AKT/mTOR signaling activation, and increased AMPK activation in thyroid cancer cell. Furthermore, canagliflozin inhibited G1/S phase transition and cyclin D1, cyclin D3, cyclin E1, cyclin E2, and E2F1 expression levels in thyroid cancer cell.

4,"Increased risk of thyroid cancer among Norwegian women married to fishery workers - a retrospective cohort study The relationship between thyroid cancer in women and the occupation of their spouses was examined in a retrospective cohort study, with special reference to fishery. Of the 2.9 million women registered in the Central Population Registry of Norway on 31 December 1991, 1.2 million women had a spouse registered with an occupation in one or more of the censuses in 1960, 1970 or 1980. The women were assigned to ten broad categories based on the first digit of their husbands five-digit Nordic occupational classification code NYK, and a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated for each occupational category. The women were further subdivided and analysed in 71 groups defined by the first two digits of the NYK code. Among the women included in the study, a total of 2409 cases of thyroid cancer were reported to the cancer registry of Norway during 1960-92. A significantly elevated risk of thyroid cancer was found only among women whose spouses belonged to the occupational category 'agriculture, forestry or fishery' (n = 208 279), with a SIR of 1.13. In the group associated with 'fishing, whaling and sealing work' (n = 40 839), the risk was further increased (SIR 1.91, CI 1.65-2.21). An increased risk was also detected in the group associated with 'ship officers and pilots work' (n = 29 133) (SIR 1.35, CI 1.07-1.67). When allocating the women to southern and northern cohorts determined by their county of birth, a difference in risk was clearly present in all 10 occupational categories, with figures being 50-60% higher in the north. However, there was practically no difference in incidence between northern and southern cohorts among women associated with fishery work. Thus, the results obtained from this study indicate that being a fisherman's wife is associated with elevated risk of thyroid cancer, and our data support the suggested role of seafood as an aetiological factor."
4,"Did Introducing a New Category of Thyroid Tumors (Non-invasive Follicular Thyroid Neoplasm with Papillary-like Nuclear Features) Decrease the Risk of Malignancy for the Diagnostic Categories in the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology? In 2016, Nikiforov et al. (JAMA Oncol 2:1023-1029, 2016) proposed replacing the term ""non-invasive encapsulated follicular variant of papillary thyroid carcinoma"" (FVPTC) with the term ""non-invasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features"" (NIFTP). In 2018, to avoid the misdiagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer as NIFTP, the authors proposed changes to the criteria for NIFTP classification. Some previous studies evaluated the impact of NIFTP on the risk of malignancy (ROM) in the fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) diagnostic categories according to the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC). However, little is known about the influence of an NIFTP diagnosis on ROM on the basis of the revised criteria. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of NIFTP on ROM using the revised diagnostic criteria. The present study included 998 thyroid nodules that were diagnosed and resected at the same medical center. All specimens with a diagnosis of cancer were reviewed to identify NIFTP according to the revised 2018 criteria. Additionally, molecular diagnostics were performed to detect the BRAF p.V600E mutation and TERT promoter mutations in all the NIFTP cases. The number of cases that met the revised criteria was determined, and the ROM was calculated in each of the FNAC diagnostic categories. Only five cases (2.3% of all papillary thyroid carcinoma diagnoses) were considered NIFTP, according to the 2018 criteria. With respect to the FNAC category, one case was a follicular neoplasm or suspicious for a follicular neoplasm (FN/SFN), three cases were suspicious for malignancy (SM), and one case was malignant (M). The ROM decreased in each of the Bethesda categories (0.7% in FN/SFN, 4.3% in SM, and 0.5% in M) when a diagnosis of NIFTP was taken into account. These reductions were not statistically significant. These data indicate that the NIFTP entity has very little impact on ROM for the diagnostic categories of the Bethesda system."
4,"Gene expression profile of epithelial-mesenchymal transition mediators in papillary thyroid cancer. Platelet derived growth receptor alpha (PDGFRA) promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in thyroid follicular cells and is linked to lymphatic metastases in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). We probed the regulatory network of genes linked to PDGFRA and EMT, comparing matched patient primary tumor and metastatic specimens, as well as engineered cell lines and ex vivo primary cultures with and without PDGFRA. Freshly isolated thyroid tumors with or without metastases, with matching neighboring benign or normal tissue, was isolated for comparative transcriptional analysis using a TaqMan Low Density array (TLDA) assay with genes representing important markers of EMT, cellular adhesion, apoptosis, differentiation, senescence, and signal transduction pathways in thyroid cancer. Transfected primary cultures and immortalized cell lines were also analyzed with respect to PDGFRA expression and cell phenotype. We reveal the consistent upregulation of serine protease DPP4 and structural protein SPP1 with the progression of PTC to metastatic disease, as well as with PDGFRA expression. Conversely, epithelial integrity gene TFF3 and transcription factor SOX10 were strongly down-regulated. This gene network also includes important mediators of EMT including DSG1, MMP3, MMP9, and BECN. We observed similar genomic changes in ex vivo normal thyroid cells transfected with PDGFRA that also exhibited a partially dedifferentiated phenotype. In particular, we observed lamellopodia with induction of PDGFRA and illustrate that DPP4 and SPP1 were upregulated in this process, with decreased TFF3 and SOX10 as seen in tissue specimens. PDGFRA did decrease nuclear protein levels of differentiation factor TTF1, but not the transcription of TTF1 and PAX8. We demonstrate that PDGFRA activates EMT pathways and decreases expression of genes favoring epithelial integrity, pushing follicular cells toward a dedifferentiated phenotype. SPP1 and DPP4, previously linked with adverse outcomes in thyroid cancer, appear to be regulated by PDGFRA. PDGFRA expression promotes metastatic disease through multiple EMT levers that favor formation of an invasive phenotype and increased metalloproteinase expression."
4,"The role of cellular heterogeneity in thyroid cancer: a multi-modal analysis approach with Mendelian randomization. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Thyroid cancer pathogenesis involves complex interactions between genetic predisposition and alterations in the tumor microenvironment.

4,"The association of body size, reproductive factors and thyroid cancer. A population-based case-control study of the association of diet and other factors and thyroid cancer was conducted between 1980 and 1987 on Oahu, Hawaii. Study participants included 51 men and 140 women with thyroid cancer, and 113 male and 328 female controls matched on age (+/- 5 years) and sex. A significant, positive monotonic dose-response relation of weight in late adulthood (5 years prior to interview) and the risk for thyroid cancer was found for men and women. A greater than five-fold increase in the risk for thyroid cancer among men, and more than a two-fold increase in risk among women, was found for subjects in the highest compared with the lowest quartile of weight in late adulthood. Height was significantly related to the risk for thyroid cancer among men, but not women. Among men, there was a significant dose-response relation of weight in early adulthood (20-29 years of age) and the odds ratios (ORs) for thyroid cancer, although the trend was not significant after adjustment for height. Among women, there was also a positive relation of adult weight gain and thyroid cancer, with an OR of 2.6 associated with more than a 14% increase in weight. The effects of relative weight and weight gain on thyroid cancer risk were stronger in post-menopausal women than in premenopausal women. There was a significant positive interaction between fertility drug use and early adult weight and the risk for thyroid cancer in women. Odds ratios were also significantly elevated for women above the median weight in early adulthood who experienced a miscarriage or stillbirth at first pregnancy. In summary, these data show an association of weight, particularly in late adulthood, and the risk for thyroid cancer in men and women, and further suggest a positive interaction between weight in young adulthood and fertility drug use on thyroid carcinogenesis in women."
4,"The genomic and transcriptomic landscape of anaplastic thyroid cancer: implications for therapy Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is the most undifferentiated form of thyroid cancer and one of the deadliest of all adult solid malignancies. Here we report the first genomic and transcriptomic profile of anaplastic thyroid cancer including those of several unique cell lines and outline novel potential drivers of malignancy and targets of therapy. We describe whole genomic and transcriptomic profiles of 1 primary anaplastic thyroid tumor and 3 authenticated cell lines. Those profiles augmented by the transcriptomes of 4 additional and unique cell lines were compared to 58 pairs of papillary thyroid carcinoma and matched normal tissue transcriptomes from The Cancer Genome Atlas study. The most prevalent mutations were those of TP53 and BRAF; repeated alterations of the epigenetic machinery such as frame-shift deletions of HDAC10 and EP300, loss of SMARCA2 and fusions of MECP2, BCL11A and SS18 were observed. Sequence data displayed aneuploidy and large regions of copy loss and gain in all genomes. Common regions of gain were however evident encompassing chromosomes 5p and 20q. We found novel anaplastic gene fusions including MKRN1-BRAF, FGFR2-OGDH and SS18-SLC5A11, all expressed in-frame fusions involving a known proto-oncogene. Comparison of the anaplastic thyroid cancer expression datasets with the papillary thyroid cancer and normal thyroid tissue transcriptomes suggested several known drug targets such as FGFRs, VEGFRs, KIT and RET to have lower expression levels in anaplastic specimens compared with both papillary thyroid cancers and normal tissues, confirming the observed lack of response to therapies targeting these pathways. Further integrative data analysis identified the mTOR signaling pathway as a potential therapeutic target in this disease. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma possessed heterogeneous and unique profiles revealing the significance of detailed molecular profiling of individual tumors and the treatment of each as a unique entity; the cell line sequence data promises to facilitate the more accurate and intentional drug screening studies for anaplastic thyroid cancer."
4,"Risk of second primary thyroid cancer in cancer survivors. A risk factor for thyroid cancer (TC) may be a history of former cancer and cancer therapy. The precise risk of a second primary thyroid carcinoma has not yet been revealed. In this study, we evaluated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of second primary thyroid cancer (SPTC) with consideration of different conditions and further analyzed the clinicopathological characteristics and survival of these patients. The cohort was selected from the US Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program between 1975 and 2019. The standardized incidence ratios, morbidity risk, clinicopathological features, and survival of second primary thyroid carcinoma were analyzed. Propensity score matching (PSM) was used to balance covariates. Kaplan-Meier method was performed to assess the survival outcomes. Overall, 7066 patients with SPTC and 83,113 patients with primary TC were identified. The SIR of TC in tumor patients was 1.51/10,000, statistically higher than the natural population (0.94/10,000, P < 0.05). The most significant tumors contributing to the increased SIRs of SPTC were acute lymphocytic leukemia (3.49/10,000), Hodgkin's lymphoma-nodal (3.29/10,000), salivary gland cancer (3.23/10,000), and kidney and renal pelvis cancer (3.05/10,000). The incidence of TC increased significantly in tumor patients who received radiotherapy/chemotherapy before age 35. The age at diagnosis of the SPTC was much older than the primary TC (64.01 vs. 49.55 years, p < 0.001). The SPTC had a higher percentage of histological grades 3/4 (23.14% vs. 15.19%, p < 0.001). Survival analyses demonstrated a worse prognosis for the SPTC group compared to the primary TC group. But after PSM, the survival outcomes of the two groups tended to be equivalent (P = 0.584). The SIRs of TC are higher in tumor patients. The most significant factors contributing to the increased risk of SPTC were some specific former tumors and acceptance of radiotherapy/ chemotherapy before age 35. There was no significant difference in survival between SPTC and primary TC."
4,"Frequency and Type of Thyroid Carcinoma in Patients With Multinodular Goiter. Background This study aimed to investigate the incidence and subtype of thyroid cancer in multinodular goitre (MNG) patients who underwent total thyroidectomy. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Khyber Teaching Hospital, screening 207 MNG patients who received complete thyroidectomies between July and December 2022. The senior consultant diagnosed thyroid cancer based on a complete history, physical examination, and laboratory and radiological studies. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration cytology was performed by a senior consultant radiologist. Bethesda categories for all lesions were recorded. All patients underwent thyroidectomy, and the diagnosis of thyroid cancer was confirmed on histopathology.  Results A total of 207 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 45.55 ± 8.75 years. Out of 207 patients, 24 (11.59%) were diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Out of 62 male patients, 15 (7.25%) had thyroid cancer. Out of 145 female patients, only nine had cancer (p < 0.001). Nine patients with thyroid cancer had a body mass index (BMI) below 18, compared to only five patients with a BMI of more than 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The difference in age distribution was not significant in our study (p = 0.102).  Conclusion  In conclusion, our study sheds light on the frequency and potential risk factors associated with thyroid cancer in patients with multinodular goiter. Our findings reveal that papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most commonly observed form of thyroid cancer in this patient population, with around 12 percent of patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer. Notably, our study highlights that male patients and those with a lower BMI may have a greater risk of developing thyroid cancer in the context of multinodular goiter. The findings of this study have important implications for the care and follow-up of MNG patients who receive total thyroidectomy. Further research is needed to investigate the type and prognosis of thyroid cancer in patients with MNG."

4,"Potassium iodide (KI) to block the thyroid from exposure to I-131: current questions and answers to be discussed. Thyroid cancer in children and adolescents has to be considered as the most severe health consequence of a nuclear reactor emergency with release of radioiodine into the atmosphere. High doses of potassium iodide are effective to block radioiodine thyroid uptake and to prevent development of thyroid cancer years later. However, there are controversies concerning thyroid cancer risk induced by radioiodine exposure in adults. Further, the interaction of nutritional supply of potassium iodide and radioiodine uptake as well as the interaction of radioiodine with certain drugs has not been addressed properly in existing guidelines and recommendations. How to proceed in case of repeated release of radioiodine is an open, very important question which came up again recently during the Fukushima accident. Lastly, the side effects of iodine thyroid blocking and alternatives of this procedure have not been addressed systematically up to now in guidelines and recommendations. These questions can be answered as follows: in adults, the risk to develop thyroid cancer is negligible. In countries, where nutritional iodine deficiency is still an issue, the risk to develop thyroid cancer after a nuclear reactor emergency has to be considered higher because the thyroid takes up more radioiodine as in the replete condition. Similarly, in patients suffering from thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism or endemic goitre not being adequately treated radioiodine uptake is higher than in healthy people. In case of repeated or continued radioiodine release, more than one dose of potassium iodide may be necessary and be taken up to 1 week. Repeated iodine thyroid blocking obviously is not harmful. Side effects of iodine thyroid blocking should not be overestimated; there is little evidence for adverse effects in adults. Newborns and babies, however, may be more sensitive to side effects. In the rare case of iodine hypersensitivity, potassium perchlorate may be applied as an alternative to iodine for thyroid blocking."
4,"Thyroid cancer following exposure to radioactive iodine. The thyroid gland is one of the most sensitive organs for radiation-induced oncogenesis and the magnitude of the risk from external radiation is well understood. This is not the case for internal radiation derived from the radioiodines, a matter of practical importance because of medical use and potential accidental exposure. This article reviews current knowledge derived from the follow-up of patients receiving diagnostic or therapeutic 131I and populations exposed to radioactive fallout. The latter includes the nuclear power station accident at Chernobyl and the results of atomic bomb development and testing at Hanford, the Nevada Test Site and the Marshall Islands. The most cogent information comes from Chernobyl where an epidemic of childhood thyroid cancer has followed exposure to radioiodine that was mainly 131I. Although much has been learned from this experience about the nature of radioiodine induced thyroid cancer in young children, the reconstruction of thyroid radiation doses is too preliminary to provide accurate knowledge of the risk in comparison to that from external radiation. In the Marshall Islands, much of the exposure was from short-lived radioiodines as well as external radiation, obviating the possibility to determine the risk from 131I. Exposure to 131I in the continental United States from atomic bomb testing is expected to have caused some thyroid cancers, but only in the immediate vicinity of the Nevada Test Site has any evidence of radiation-induced thyroid neoplasms been adduced. This evidence is minimally significant statistically, and not significant for thyroid cancer per se. Medical use of radioiodine has not been observed to cause thyroid cancer but very few of the patients studied were young children, the group most sensitive to thyroid radiation. Despite these limitations, this information is sufficient to make some suggestions concerning protective measures in the case of nuclear accidents and the follow up of individuals who have been exposed."
4,"Regulators of Glucose Uptake in Thyroid Cancer Cell Lines Thyroid cancer is the most common sort of endocrine-related cancer with more prevalent in women and elderly individuals which has quickly widespread expansion in worldwide over the recent decades. Common features of malignant thyroid cells are to have accelerated metabolism and increased glucose uptake to optimize their energy supply which provides a fundamental advantage for growth. In tumor cells the retaining of required energy charge for cell survival is imperative, indeed glucose transporters are enable of promoting of this task. According to this relation it has been reported the upregulation of glucose transporters in various types of cancers. Human studies indicated that poor survival can be occurred following the high levels of GLUT1 expression in tumors. GLUT-1 and GLUT3 are the glucose transporters which seems to be mainly engaged with the oncogenesis of thyroid cancer and their expression in malignant tissues is much more than in the normal one. They are promising targets for the advancement of anticancer strategies. The lack of oncosuppressors have dominant effect on the membrane expression of GLUT1 and glucose uptake. Overexpression of hypoxia inducible factors have been additionally connected with distant metastasis in thyroid cancers which mediates transcriptional regulation of glycolytic genes including GLUT1 and GLUT3. Though the physiological role of the thyroid gland is well illustrated, but the metabolic regulations in thyroid cancer remain evasive. In this study we discuss proliferation pathways of the key regulators and signaling molecules such as PI3K-Akt, HIF-1, MicroRNA, PTEN, AMPK, BRAF, c-Myc, TSH, Iodide and p53 which includes in the regulation of GLUTs in thyroid cancer cells. Incidence of deregulations in cellular energetics and metabolism are the most serious signs of cancers. In conclusion, understanding the mechanisms of glucose transportation in normal and pathologic thyroid tissues is critically important and could provide significant insights in science of diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disease."
4,"Retrospective Evaluation of Bone Metastases in Patients With Thyroid Malignancy: A Single-Center Experience. Background Thyroid cancer is one of the five most common cancers causing bone metastasis. If there is an increase in serum thyroglobulin-antithyroglobulin levels in differentiated thyroid cancer or calcitonin levels in medullary thyroid cancer, patients should be evaluated for recurrence and distant metastasis. The skeleton is the second most common site of distant metastasis in thyroid cancer after the lung. Bone metastases cause pain, fractures, and spinal cord compression, severely reducing the quality of life. They are associated with poor prognosis. Bone metastases severely reduce the quality of life. This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with thyroid cancer with bone metastases diagnosed at our center. Methodology A total of 1,390 patients diagnosed with thyroid malignancy at our center between 2010 and 2023 were reviewed retrospectively. The study included 27 patients with differentiated and medullary thyroid cancer who had bone metastases. Results Of 27 patients, 19 (70.4%) had differentiated and eight (29.6%) had medullary thyroid cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer constituted 22.2% (<i>n</i> = 6) and follicular thyroid cancer constituted 14.8% (<i>n</i> = 4) of the cases. Papillary carcinoma follicular variant, oncocytic, and poorly differentiated thyroid cancer were diagnosed with similar frequency, each accounting for 11.1% (<i>n</i> = 3). It was found that vertebrae were most commonly involved, followed by the pelvis, sternum, costae, femur and patella, shoulder and humerus, cranium, and scapula. The five-year survival rate was 72%, and the 10-year survival rate was 53%. Conclusions The number of patients with papillary cancer was the highest, but the rate of bone metastases was the lowest in this group. The highest rate of bone metastases was found in patients with poorly differentiated, oncocytic, medullary, follicular, and papillary cancer, respectively. The results obtained in this study reveal the necessity and importance of bone metastasis evaluation in patients with thyroid cancer."

4,"Orthotopic mouse models for the preclinical and translational study of targeted therapies against metastatic human thyroid carcinoma with BRAF V600E or wild-type BRAF Molecular signature of advanced and metastatic thyroid carcinoma involves deregulation of multiple fundamental pathways activated in the tumor microenvironment. They include BRAFV600E and AKT that affect tumor initiation, progression and metastasis. Human thyroid cancer orthotopic mouse models are based on human cell lines that generally harbor genetic alterations found in human thyroid cancers. They can reproduce in vivo and in situ (into the thyroid) many features of aggressive and refractory human advanced thyroid carcinomas, including local invasion and metastasis. Humanized orthotopic mouse models seem to be ideal and commonly used for preclinical and translational studies of compounds and therapies not only because they may mimic key aspects of human diseases (e.g. metastasis), but also for their reproducibility. In addition, they might provide the possibility to evaluate systemic effects of treatments. So far, human thyroid cancer in vivo models were mainly used to test single compounds, non selective and selective. Despite the greater antitumor activity and lower toxicity obtained with different selective drugs in respect to non-selective ones, most of them are only able to delay disease progression, which ultimately could restart with similar aggressive behavior. Aggressive thyroid tumors (for example, anaplastic or poorly differentiated thyroid carcinoma) carry several complex genetic alterations that are likely cooperating to promote disease progression and might confer resistance to single-compound approaches. Orthotopic models of human thyroid cancer also hold the potential to be good models for testing novel combinatorial therapies. In this article, we will summarize results on preclinical testing of selective and nonselective single compounds in orthotopic mouse models based on validated human thyroid cancer cell lines harboring the BRAFV600E mutation or with wild-type BRAF. Furthermore, we will discuss the potential use of this model also for combinatorial approaches, which are expected to take place in the upcoming human thyroid cancer basic and clinical research."
4,"The platelet to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio is associated with thyroid hormone abnormalities based on NHANES 2007 to 2012 data. Thyroid hormone abnormalities are closely associated with metabolic and cardiovascular diseases, yet easily accessible predictors remain limited. This study aimed to investigate the association between the platelet/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (PHR) and thyroid hormone levels, including thyroid dysfunction. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) spanning 2007 to 2012 were analyzed. Weighted multiple linear and logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between PHR and thyroid hormone levels, as well as the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction. Subgroup analyses, smoothing curve fitting, and threshold effect analyses were also conducted to further explore potential associations. A total of 8440 participants were included, with a mean age of 47.83 ± 18.48 years and a mean platelet/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (PHR) of 20.64 ± 8.43. Significant differences in thyroid hormone levels were observed across PHR quartiles, with higher PHR quartiles associated with elevated FT3, TT4, and hypothyroidism prevalence, and lower FT4/FT3 and FT4/TT4 ratios.In unadjusted models, PHR was positively correlated with FT3 (β = 0.007, P < 0.001), TT4 (β = 0.017, P < 0.001), and hypothyroidism (OR = 1.024, P = 0.012), and negatively correlated with FT4/FT3 and FT4/TT4 ratios. After adjusting for potential confounders, these associations remained significant. The odds of hypothyroidism were higher in Q2 and Q4 compared to Q1.Nonlinear associations were observed in the threshold effect analysis, with inflection points for FT3 and TT4 at 10.050 and 24.706, respectively. Below these points, PHR showed a negative association with FT3 and a positive association with TT4, while the associations plateaued above the inflection points. PHR, a readily available biomarker, is significantly associated with FT3, TT4, and the prevalence of hypothyroidism. These findings suggest that PHR could serve as a promising marker for predicting thyroid hormone abnormalities, especially in resource-limited settings where routine thyroid screening is not feasible."
4,"Increased thyroid cancer risk in acromegaly Acromegaly increases cancer risk. We aimed to determine the prevalence and the predictors of tumors in acromegalic patients treated at our department. We retrospectively evaluated 160 acromegalic patients [79 female (mean age 52.0 ± 10.4 years) and 81 male (mean age 49.1 ± 12.4 years)] between 1990 and 2012, with a mean follow up period of 7.1 ± 5.7 years. The patients were screened with colonoscopy, mammography, thyroid and prostate ultrasonography. Malignancy was found in 34 (21.3 %) patients. No significant difference was observed in the distribution of malignancy among sexes (20.3 % in F vs. 22.2 % in M). Thyroid cancer was the most frequent (n = 17, 10.6 %) followed by the breast cancer (n = 4, 2.5 %) and colorectal cancer (n = 3, 1.8 %). Renal cell cancer in two patients, bladder cancer in two patients, periampullary tumor, rectal carcinoid tumor, malignant melanoma, prostate cancer, lung cancer, parotid mucoepidermoid carcinoma and malignant mesenchymal tumor in brain in one patient were detected. One patient had both thyroid and renal cell cancer. Age of patients at diagnosis of acromegaly was significantly higher in patients with cancer (45.8 ± 9.9 vs. 40.9 ± 11.3 years, p < 0.05). No significant difference was found in duration of the disease, initial GH levels and IGF-1 % upper limit of normal values, the prevalence of diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, hyperlipidemia and treatment modalities between the patients with/without cancer. In logistic regression analysis, older age at diagnosis was associated with malignancy risk. The risk of cancer in acromegaly especially the thyroid cancer risk seems to be more increased than known in the literature. Therefore, acromegaly patients should be screened routinely for cancer, especially for thyroid cancer due to it being up to four times higher prevalence than breast and colorectal cancer."
4,"The association between breast cancer and thyroid cancer: a meta-analysis Previous studies have suggested an association between breast cancer and thyroid cancer; however, there has not been a formal meta-analysis which collates the existing evidence supporting the hypothesis that breast cancer or thyroid cancer predisposes an individual to developing the other. A systematic search was carried out using PubMed and Medline. We searched for articles containing epidemiological evidence of breast cancer following thyroid cancer and vice versa. Additionally, we searched for articles that included epidemiological data involving the incidence of all second primary malignancies (SPMs) following both breast cancer and thyroid cancer, and compared the datasets. The meta-analysis performed in a total of 18 studies showed that there is a significantly increased risk of developing thyroid cancer as a second primary malignancy of breast cancer (SIR = 1.59, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.28–1.99). Additionally, there was marginally increased risk of developing breast cancer as a second primary malignancy of thyroid cancer (SIR = 1.24, 95 % CI 1.16–1.33), compared to the general risk of developing a second primary malignancy following thyroid cancer. The findings suggest that the risk of developing thyroid cancer as a second primary malignancy of breast cancer and vice versa is increased compared to the background risk of developing other SPMs. The risk of developing thyroid cancer after a primary breast cancer was higher than the risk of developing breast cancer as a second primary malignancy of thyroid cancer. This suggests that the effects of treatment-related factors and specific pathological processes of each cancer may contribute to the increased risk rather than common risk factors including genetic factors. Elucidation of the common mechanisms between breast cancer and thyroid cancer will have important implications in both diagnostic and therapeutic management of these cancers. Benefit of thyroid ultrasound screening after breast cancer surgery needs to be assessed."
4,"Nodular thyroid disease in the erderly The occurrence of thyroid nodules increases with age [1]. In geographical areas with a normal iodine intake, approximately 10% of the population develops a palpable thyroid nodule. This proportion increases in areas with insufficient iodine intake. Non-palpable thyroid nodules are usually diagnosed by a neck echography carried out for various reasons and are 5-10 folds more common than palpable nodules.; ; When evaluating a thyroid nodule, we must be aware that two conditions require particular attention: a) the possibility of a “hot” (hyperfunctioning) nodule, which can induce thyrotoxicosis; b) the possibility of a malignant nodule.; ; Both these pathological conditions increase with age [2,3]. In particular, elderly patients often show a multinodular goiter, where both hyperfunctioning nodules and hypofunctioning nodules suspicious for malignancy may coexist. When FT3 is high and/or TSH is suppressed a hyperfunctioning nodule should be suspected. In order to confirm this diagnosis the patient should carry out a thyroid scintigram. In the case that both FT3 and TSH are in the normal range, the nodule should be regarded as non-functioning. In this case a thyroid scintigram is not useful whereas a fine needle aspiration (FNAB) is the diagnostic procedure of choice [4].; ; Both hyperfunctioning and malignant thyroid nodules are more common in elderly patients. Notably, hyperthyroidism is a more serious condition in the elderly than in the young because of an increased risk of cardiac dysfunction. Moreover, thyroid cancer behaves more aggressively in elderly patients. In these patients thyroid cancer is usually less differentiated and lacks the ability to concentrate iodine. Therefore, thyroid cancer metastases cannot be treated with radioiodine.; ; In the case of a hyperfunctioning nodule the therapy of choice is a thyroid lobectomy. In contrast, in the case of a multinodular goiter or of a malignant nodule, a total thyrodectomy is required."
4,"Familial Follicular Cell Tumors: Classification and Morphological Characteristics Familial follicular cell-derived well-differentiated thyroid cancer, papillary (PTC), and follicular thyroid carcinomas (FTC), accounts for 95% of thyroid malignancies. The majority of are sporadic, and at least 5% of these patients will have familial disease. Familial thyroid syndromes are classified into familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), derived from calcitonin-producing C cells, and familial follicular cell tumors or non-medullary thyroid carcinoma (FNMTC), derived from follicular cells. Twenty-five percent of patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) have a familial form; however, this accounts for only 1% of all patients with thyroid cancer. The familial follicular cell-derived lesions or familial non-medullary thyroid cancer can be divided into two clinical–pathological groups. The first group includes familial syndromes characterized by a predominance of non-thyroidal tumors, such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), PTEN-hamartoma tumor syndrome (Cowden disease; PHTS), Carney complex, Werner syndrome, and Pendred syndrome. The second group includes familial syndromes characterized by predominance of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), such as pure fPTC, fPTC associated with papillary renal cell carcinoma, and fPTC with multinodular goiter. Most of the progress in the genetics of familial thyroid cancer has been in patients with MTC. This is usually a component of multiple endocrine neoplasias IIA or IIB, or as pure familial medullary thyroid carcinoma syndrome. The genetic events in the familial C-cell-derived tumors are known and genotype–phenotype correlations are well established. The mutations in patients with isolated NMFTC have not been as well defined as in MTC. In many cases, patients have a known familial syndrome that has defined risk for thyroid cancer. The clinician must be knowledgeable in recognizing the possibility of an underlying familial syndrome when a patient presents with thyroid cancer. Some characteristic thyroid morphologic findings should alert the pathologist of a possible familial cancer syndrome, which may lead to further molecular genetics evaluation."
4,"Changing management in patients with papillary thyroid cancer. The incidence of thyroid cancer has been increasing over the past 30 years, and it is now the seventh most common cancer in women. Papillary thyroid cancer is the most common subtype of thyroid cancer, occurring in 80% of cases. Its main pattern of spread is to cervical lymph nodes, with distant metastases occurring uncommonly. Initial treatment of papillary thyroid cancer involves resection of the primary tumor, with resection of regional lymph nodes if involved with metastatic disease. Postoperative adjuvant therapy consists of radioactive iodine ablation for most patients, followed by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression with thyroxine. An ongoing controversy in the surgical treatment of papillary thyroid cancer is that of extent of thyroid gland and nodal resection. Consensus guidelines recommend total or near-total thyroidectomy, rather than thyroid lobectomy, as the initial procedure of choice, given its advantages of treating potential multicentric disease, facilitating maximal uptake of adjuvant radioactive iodine, and facilitating the post-treatment follow-up by monitoring serum thyroglobulin (Tg) levels. In the hands of an experienced endocrine surgeon, complication rates are comparable to those for lobectomy. Major changes in the management of patients with papillary thyroid cancer over the last 10 years include the use of preoperative neck ultrasound, which can detect nonpalpable cervical lymph node metastases and potentially change the initial operation. In addition, neck ultrasound and measurement of serum Tg levels have taken the place of routine whole body radioactive iodine scans in the postoperative follow-up of patients with papillary thyroid cancer. Recurrent locoregional cervical lymph node disease should be treated by compartmental lymph node dissection, followed by another treatment dose of radioactive iodine. Chemotherapy is generally ineffective for the treatment of metastatic disease. For those patients whose tumor has become radioactive iodine resistant, emerging therapies include redifferentiation agents, antiangiogenic agents, and multi-tyrosine kinase inhibitors."
4,"Thyroid and renal tumors in patients treated with long-term lithium: case series from a lithium clinic, review of the literature and international pharmacovigilance reports Cancer had never been considered as a relevant problem in patients treated with lithium until 2015, when a document published by the European Medicine Agency concluded that long-term use of lithium might induce renal tumors. A few months later, we observed the case of a woman treated with lithium for 18 years who was diagnosed with both thyroid and renal tumors. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between lithium treatment and thyroid or renal tumors. We analyzed clinical records in our lithium clinic database, causes of death of patients who had been visited at least once at the lithium clinic, reports of lithium adverse reactions in the European and WHO pharmacovigilance databases, and published cases of thyroid and renal tumors in long-term lithium-treated patients. Of the 1871 lithium patients who had been visited at least once between 1980 and 2013, eight had been diagnosed with thyroid papillary carcinoma and two with clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma. No cases of thyroid cancer and only one case of renal tumor were the cause of death according to the 375 available death certificates. VigiAccess database contained a total of 29 and 14 cases of renal and thyroid tumors, respectively. EudraVigilance database contained 21 cases of renal and 8 of thyroid neoplasms. Literature search yielded 6 published cases of thyroid papillary carcinoma and 25 cases of various renal tumors. However, two population-based studies did not find any increased risks of cancer in patients exposed to lithium, whereas two nationwide studies did not find any excess of renal tumors. So far it has not been possible epidemiologically to confirm an increased risk of thyroid or renal cancers associated with lithium. Such a conclusion is supported by the findings of low rates and mortalities of thyroid or renal cancers from the present lithium clinic data."
4,"A review of species differences in the control of, and response to, chemical-induced thyroid hormone perturbations leading to thyroid cancer This review summarises the current state of knowledge regarding the physiology and control of production of thyroid hormones, the effects of chemicals in perturbing their synthesis and release that result in thyroid cancer. It does not consider the potential neurodevelopmental consequences of low thyroid hormones. There are a number of known molecular initiating events (MIEs) that affect thyroid hormone synthesis in mammals and many chemicals are able to activate multiple MIEs simultaneously. AOP analysis of chemical-induced thyroid cancer in rodents has defined the key events that predispose to the development of rodent cancer and many of these will operate in humans under appropriate conditions, if they were exposed to high enough concentrations of the affecting chemicals. There are conditions however that, at the very least, would indicate significant quantitative differences in the sensitivity of humans to these effects, with rodents being considerably more sensitive to thyroid effects by virtue of differences in the biology, transport and control of thyroid hormones in these species as opposed to humans where turnover is appreciably lower and where serum transport of T4/T3 is different to that operating in rodents. There is heated debate around claimed qualitative differences between the rodent and human thyroid physiology, and significant reservations, both scientific and regulatory, still exist in terms of the potential neurodevelopmental consequences of low thyroid hormone levels at critical windows of time. In contrast, the situation for the chemical induction of thyroid cancer, through effects on thyroid hormone production and release, is less ambiguous with both theoretical, and actual data, showing clear dose-related thresholds for the key events predisposing to chemically induced thyroid cancer in rodents. In addition, qualitative differences in transport, and quantitative differences in half life, catabolism and turnover of thyroid hormones, exist that would not operate under normal situations in humans."
4,"Thyroid cancer risks among medical radiation workers in South Korea, 1996–2015 Thyroid cancer rates, especially among children, are known to be increased by radiation exposure. However, little is known about the impact of chronic low-dose radiation exposure on thyroid cancer risk in adulthood. This study examined radiation effects on thyroid cancer rates as well as an overall evaluation of thyroid cancer risk among medical radiation workers. Data on all diagnostic medical radiation workers enrolled in the national dosimetry registry between 1996 and 2011 were linked with the cancer registry data through 2015. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to compare the observed cancer incidence rates in this population to those for the general population while internal comparisons were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) for occupational history and excess relative risks (ERRs) were used to quantify the radiation dose-response relationship. Overall, 827 thyroid cancer cases were reported among 93,922 medical radiation workers. Thyroid cancer SIRs were significantly higher than expected for both men (SIR 1.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.53 to 1.91) and women (SIR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.28). However, RRs for thyroid cancer by job title and duration of employment showed no particular pattern among diagnostic medical radiation workers. There were no indications of a significant dose effect on thyroid cancer rates for either men (ERR/100 mGy 0.07, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.53) or women (ERR/100 mGy -0.13, 95% CI -0.49 to 0.23). The findings were similar for different job titles or when limited to workers employed for at least one year. While thyroid cancer incidence rates among Korean medical radiation workers were somewhat higher than those in the general population, there was no significant evidence that this increase was associated with occupational radiation dose. Additional follow-up together with consideration of other risk factors should provide useful information on thyroid cancer rates in this cohort."
4,"Tumor microenvironment remodeling across thyroid cancer differentiation states revealed by spatial transcriptomics. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, with an increasing incidence, particularly driven by differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC), including papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC). Although DTC generally have excellent prognosis, dedifferentiated forms such as poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) exhibit aggressive progression and poor outcomes. Understanding the tumor microenvironment (TME) is crucial for developing novel therapeutic strategies.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We performed spatial transcriptomics (ST) on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissues from 12 patients with PTC, FTC, PDTC, or ATC using the Visium CytAssist platform.

Intratumoral heterogeneity in the Thyroid Differentiation Score (TDS) showed a strong spatial correlation with myeloid cell density, and among myeloid subtypes, the MDSC score was negatively correlated with TDS. Pathway activity analysis further identified upregulation of the JAK-STAT and VEGF signaling pathways in dedifferentiated tumors, both of which were closely associated with increased myeloid cell infiltration. IHC validation confirmed the differential expression patterns of representative immune and stromal markers across subtypes.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">These findings suggest that dedifferentiation in thyroid cancer is associated with an immunosuppressive TME that promotes tumor progression.

4,"Activation of tumor cell proliferation by thyroid hormone in a mouse model of follicular thyroid carcinoma Thyroid cancers are the most common malignancy of the endocrine system in humans. To understand the molecular genetic events underlying thyroid carcinogenesis, we have generated a mouse model that spontaneously develops follicular thyroid carcinoma similar to human thyroid cancer (Thrb(PV/PV) mouse). This mutant mouse harbors a dominant-negative mutated thyroid hormone receptor β (denoted PV). The PV mutation was identified in a patient with resistance to thyroid hormone (TH). Thrb(PV/PV) mice exhibit highly elevated serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and increased TH. We have previously shown that thyroid-stimulating hormone is required, but not sufficient to induce metastatic follicular thyroid cancer in Thrb(PV/PV) mice. However, whether the elevated TH also contributes to the thyroid carcinogenesis of Thrb(PV/PV) mice was not elucidated. To understand the role of TH in thyroid carcinogenesis, we blocked the production of TH by treating Thrb(PV/PV) mice with propylthiouracil (Thrb(PV/PV)-PTU mice) and compared the development of thyroid cancer in Thrb(PV/PV)-PTU and untreated Thrb(PV/PV) mice. We found that thyroid tumor growth was reduced by ∼42% in Thrb(PV/PV)-PTU mice as compared with Thrb(PV/PV) mice. Analysis by bromodeoxyuridine-nuclear labeling showed decreased incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine in thyroid tumor cells of Thrb(PV/PV)-PTU mice, indicative of decreased tumor cell proliferation. However, cleaved-caspase 3 staining showed no apparent changes in apoptosis of tumor cells in Thrb(PV/PV)-PTU mice. Molecular studies identified a marked attenuation of the PI3K-AKT-β-catenin signaling pathway that led to decreased protein levels of cyclin D2, thereby decreasing tumor cell proliferation in Thrb(PV/PV)-PTU mice. Furthermore, matrix metalloproteinase-2, a downstream target of β-catenin and a key regulator during tumor invasion and metastasis, was also decreased. Thus, the present study uncovers a critical role of TH in promoting the thyroid carcinogenesis of Thrb(PV/PV) mice via membrane signaling events. Importantly, these findings suggest that anti-thyroid drugs could be considered as possible therapeutic agents of thyroid cancer."

4,"Molecular target based combinational therapeutic approaches in thyroid cancer Thyroid cancer, as with other types of cancer, is dependent on angiogenesis for its continued growth and development. Interestingly, estrogen has been shown to contribute to thyroid cancer aggressiveness in vitro, which is in full support of the observed increased incidence of thyroid cancer in women over men. Provided that estrogen has been observed to contribute to increased angiogenesis of estrogen responsive breast cancer, it is conceivable to speculate that estrogen also contributes to angiogenesis of estrogen responsive thyroid cancer. In this study, three human thyroid cancer cells (B-CPAP, CGTH-W-1, ML-1) were treated with estrogen alone or estrogen and anti-estrogens (fulvestrant and 3,3′-diindolylmethane, a natural dietary compound) for 24 hours. The cell culture media was then added to human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVECs) and assayed for angiogenesis associated events. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were also quantified in the conditioned media so as to evaluate if it is a key player involved in these observations. Conditioned medium from estrogen treated thyroid cancer cells enhanced phenotypical changes (proliferation, migration and tubulogenesis) of endothelial cells typically observed during angiogenesis. These phenotypic changes observed in HUVECs were determined to be modulated by estrogen induced secretion of VEGF by the cancer cells. Lastly, we show that VEGF secretion was inhibited by the anti-estrogens, fulvestrant and 3,3′-diindolylmethane, which resulted in diminished angiogenesis associated events in HUVECs. Our data establishes estrogen as being a key regulator of VEGF secretion/expression in thyroid cells which enhances the process of angiogenesis in thyroid cancer. These findings also suggest the clinical utility of anti-estrogens as anti-angiogenic compounds to be used as a therapeutic means to treat thyroid cancer. We also observed that 3,3′-diindolylmethane is a promising naturally occurring anti-estrogen which can be used as a part of therapeutic regimen to treat thyroid cancer."
4,"The central lymph node dissection using carbon nanoparticle in transoral vestibular approach endoscopic thyroid surgery. This research seeks to explore the application value of carbon nanoparticle (CN) in transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy vestibular approach (TOETVA) with the goal of providing more reliable clinical evidence for minimally invasive treatment of thyroid cancer.A total of 110 patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) met the inclusion and exclusion criteria from September 2019 to January 2020. They were divided into an experimental group (TOETVA group) of 80 patients and a control group (OT group) of 30 patients based on their cosmetic preferences. All patients were treated with CN during surgery, and the surgeon actively selected lymph nodes and sent them separately for examination according to < 5 mm (small) and ≥ 5 mm (large), recording the number of row retrieved lymph nodes (RRLN). Routine medical examination was conducted to report the number of retrieved lymph nodes (RLN) and positive central lymph nodes (PLNs) detected one week after surgery. The positive rate (PR) of lymph nodes and the proportion of lymph node positive individuals were calculated. Compared with the control group, there was no significant difference between the experimental group and the control group in the proportion of RRLN, RLN, PLN, PR, and lymph node positivity. The differences in the number of lymph nodes of the same group: small lymph nodes have more RRLN and RLN than large lymph nodes, and the difference is statistically significant. In the experimental group, RRLN is larger than RLN, the difference is statistically significant. There is a slight difference between the control group and the experimental group, RRLN is generally higher than RLN. The lymph node clearance effect of TOETVA and OT is basically consistent. The use of CN can improve the detection rate of small lymph nodes in TOETVA, and it is recommended to use CN during the procedure."
4,"Incidence and histological patterns of thyroid cancer in Sri Lanka 2001-2010: an analysis of national cancer registry data. An increasing incidence of thyroid cancer is observed in many developed countries. Increasing incidence may also reflect better reporting or increased diagnostic scrutiny. We conducted this study to examine trends in thyroid cancer incidence and histological patterns in Sri Lanka. A retrospective cohort evaluation of patients with thyroid cancer during 2001–2010 was performed using population based data published from the Sri Lanka National Cancer Registry. Trends in incidence and histological patterns were analysed by age and gender. The age-standardized incidence of thyroid cancer increased from 2.44 per 100,000 in 2001 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 2.21–2.67) to 5.16 per 100,000 in 2010 (95% CI: 4.85–5.47); a 2.1-fold increase (p < 0.05 for trend). A greater part of this increase is attributable to increase in incidence of papillary thyroid cancer, which increased from 1.64 to 3.61 per 100,000; a 2.2-fold increase (p < 0.05 for trend). Follicular cancer showed lesser, yet a significant increase from 0.56 to 0.95 per 100,000 (p < 0.05). Other varieties of thyroid cancer showed no significant increases in incidence. Trends in the increases in incidence of papillary cancer in females showed a much greater increase compared with males (from 2.45 to 5.60 per 100,000, a 2.28-fold increase in females compared with from 0.82 to 1.55; a 1.89-fold increase in males, p < 0.001). Highest incidence of papillary cancer was observed in 30–39-year age group, which has increased from 5.56 to 12.9 per 100,000; a 2.32-fold increase (p < 0.001). The increasing incidence of thyroid cancer in Sri Lanka is predominantly due to the increasing incidence of papillary cancers. These trends may reflect increased detection and better reporting, although an inherent increase in the incidence is the likely main contributor. Further studies including tumour stage and mortality may help answer these questions."
4,"Trends in incidence and histological pattern of thyroid cancer in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (1996-2015): a population-based study. The burden and trend of thyroid cancer in Vietnam have not been well documented. This study aimed to investigate the trends in incidence and histological pattern of thyroid cancer in Ho Chi Minh City from 1996 to 2015. A population-based study retrieved data from the Ho Chi Minh City Cancer Registry during 1996–2015. Trends in the incidence of thyroid cancer were investigated based on age, gender, and histology for each 5-year period. Annual percentage change (APC) in incidence rates was estimated using Joinpoint regression analysis. In the study period, there were 5953 thyroid cancer cases (men-to-women ratio 1:4.5) newly diagnosed in Ho Chi Minh City with the mean age of 42.9 years (±14.9 years). The age-standardized incidence rate of thyroid cancer increased from 2.4 per 100,000 during 1996–2000 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 2.2–2.6) to 7.5 per 100,000 during 2011–2015 (95% CI: 7.3–7.9), corresponded to an overall APC of 8.7 (95% CI 7.6–9.9). The APC in men and women was 6.2 (95% CI: 4.2–8.2) and 9.2 (95% CI: 8.0–10.4), respectively. The incidence rate in the < 45 years age group was the highest diagnosed overall and increased significantly in both men (APC 11.0) and women (APC 10.1). Both genders shared similar distribution of subtype incidences, with papillary thyroid cancer constituted the most diagnosed (73.3% in men and 85.2% in women). The papillary thyroid cancer observed a markedly increase overall (APC of 10.7 (95% CI 9.3–12.0)). There were appreciable increases in the age-standardized incidence rate of thyroid cancer in both genders, mainly contributed by the papillary subtype. The age of patients at diagnosis decreased gradually. The widespread utilization of advanced diagnostic techniques and healthcare accessibility improvement might play a potential role in these trends. Further investigations are needed to comprehend the risk factors and trends fully."
4,"Higher thyroid hormone levels and cancer. This narrative review aims to summarize the relationship between hyperthyroidism, upper reference range thyroid hormone (TH) levels, and cancer, and to address the clinical management of hyperthyroidism in cancer patients. A comprehensive search was performed by an independent reviewer through Google Scholar and PubMed Electronic databases. All searches were restricted to English language manuscripts published between 2000 and 2020. Numerous in vitro, in vivo, and population-based studies suggest cancer-stimulating effect of triiodothyronine and thyroxin. THs are presented as mediators for tumor growth, proliferation, and progression. Many population and case–control studies suggest an increased risk of several solid but also hematologic malignancies in relation to hyperthyroidism and upper normal range TH levels. However, results are not unambiguous. In this review, we will summarize population and case–control studies that investigated the relationship between hyperthyroidism, upper reference range TH levels, lower thyrotropin (TSH) levels, lower reference range TSH levels with cancer risk, cancer prognosis, and cancer outcome. The vast majority of evidence suggests an association between clinical and subclinical hyperthyroidism with the risk of developing several types of cancer. Furthermore, hyperthyroidism is also linked with a poorer cancer prognosis. In this review, we will also discuss the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism in patients with pre-existing cancer and cover the management of hyperthyroidism in cancer patients, with special attention on the role of nuclear medicine. It is crucial to emphasize the importance of the rapid establishment of euthyroidism, and consequently, the importance of radioiodine therapy, as the therapy of choice in most cancer patients. We want to show that in this day and age there still is a high relevance for I-131 to achieve a permanent solution and thus likely reduce the risk of adverse influence of hyperthyroidism on the occurrence of new and course of existing cancer cases."
4,"Radiofrequency ablation and thyroid nodules: updated systematic review. In the thyroid gland, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is being applied to both benign nodules and cancers internationally, while interest is also growing in the West. Benign thyroid nodules (BTNs) may be candidates for intervention when symptoms develop. For differentiated thyroid cancers (DTC), surgery is currently the first-line treatment. However, for candidates with high surgical risk or those who refuse to undergo repeated surgery, newer techniques such as RFA are an option. Surgery is associated with complications including hypothyroidism, voice change, hypocalcemia, and a scar. RFA has been used in Asian and European institutions as an alternative to surgery, but is relatively new in North America. Although RFA is not associated with significant complications, few randomized control trials have assessed its efficacy. The studies to date suggest a low rate of severe complications and a small need for thyroid hormone replacement following RFA. Further large-scale studies focusing on a Western population are needed. The aim of this review is to evaluate the evidence with respect to the current studies and data about the safety and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation for the management of BTNs and DTC. We systematically searched the PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Clinical Queries, and Web of Science databases, for articles published up to April 30th, 2020. Total of 75 studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review. Thirty-five studies focused on RFA use for solid nodules, 12 studies on predominantly cystic nodules, 10 for autonomously functioning thyroid nodules, and 18 studied were published on differentiated thyroid cancer. RFA seems to be an effective and safe alternative to surgery in high-risk surgical patients with thyroid cancers and for selected BTNs. Additional trials with longer follow-up in North American patients are needed to validate its full role in the armamentarium of thyroid ologists."
4,"Clinical characteristics and follow-up of intracranial metastases from thyroid cancer Intracranial metastasis from thyroid cancer is extremely rare. However, less is known about the risk factors for intracranial metastasis and its treatment from few retrospective studies. The aim of this study was to contribute to the understanding of this disease by analyzing patients with intracranial metastases from thyroid cancer. Between 2001 and 2014, the database of the National Cancer Center of Korea was searched for thyroid cancer patients. The clinical characteristics and site of distant metastasis according to the histological type were evaluated in the thyroid cancer cohort. Among the patients with intracranial metastases, the characteristics, histological type of primary cancer and metastatic brain tumor, additional synchronous or previous distant metastasis, treatment modalities, locations and characteristics on radiologic findings, time interval between the first diagnosis of the primary thyroid cancer and brain metastasis, thyroglobulin level at the first detection of intracranial metastasis and survival were reviewed. A total of 10 (0.032 %) out of 3,090 thyroid cancer patients in the National Cancer Center database were identified as having intracranial metastases. The histological types of the primary thyroid cancers were papillary for six patients, follicular for three, and poorly differentiated carcinoma for one. Six of these ten patients underwent surgical resection for intracranial lesions. Whole-brain radiotherapy or tyrosine kinase inhibitors were applied to the patients as postoperative adjuvant treatment, and stereotactic radiosurgery was considered for recurrent or surgically inoperable lesions. The overall median survival time was 33 months (range, 0.5-78 months) after diagnosis of intracranial metastasis. Surgical resection and adjuvant treatments in the contemporary era seem to result in improved survival after intracranial metastases compared with what has been reported in past studies. Considering the grave course of intracranial metastasis, the early detection and aggressive treatment of patients with a good performance status are crucial."

4,"Papillary thyroid cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), the most common thyroid malignancy, is associated with an excellent prognosis. Overall survival is more than 90%. The first-line treatment is surgical excision, and although the debate continues as to whether a total thyroidectomy or thyroid lobectomy should be recommended, most patients at the University of California, San Francisco are treated with a total thyroidectomy. Not only has this been shown to be superior for overall survival in select patient populations, but local recurrence is also significantly lower with this approach. Total thyroidectomy also optimizes the adjuvant treatment options that are unique to “differentiated” thyroid cancer because these malignant cells retain many of the features of the native thyroid follicular cell. These cellular features are used for specialized investigations and treatment options in patients with PTC. For example, PTC cells retain the ability to produce thyroglobulin, to be stimulated by thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH), and to take up iodine. These features are vital and separate differentiated thyroid cancer from other epithelial malignancies because such features can be used in clinical follow-up (monitoring serum thyroglobulin levels, whole body radioactive iodine scans) and in the treatment of patients with PTC (TSH suppression, radioactive iodine ablation of thyroid remnant, local recurrences, and regional or distant metastases). In summary, the wide array of treatment options for patients with PTC includes surgery, radioactive iodine, thyroid hormone suppression of TSH, external beam radiation (less commonly), and rarely, chemotherapy. This continues to be an area of exciting research for emerging therapy, much of which concentrates on enhancing or re-establishing the differentiated features of the thyroid cancer cell, in an effort to optimize the adjuvant treatment options. The treatment options that are chosen depend on patient factors, disease factors, and the decisions of the patient and treatment team."
4,"Multi-omics analysis unveils dysregulation of the tumor immune microenvironment and development of a machine learning-based multi-gene classifier for predicting lateral lymph node metastasis in papillary thyroid carcinoma. <AbstractText Label=""PURPOSE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">Lateral lymph node metastasis (LNM) critically influences surgical decision-making in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).

Transcriptome analysis identified 444 differentially expressed genes associated with LNM. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis revealed a module that correlated negatively with LNM, with key genes significantly enriched in Notch signaling pathway and Apelin signaling pathway. Notably, elevated neutrophils in tumor immune microenvironment was strongly associated with high LNM risk, suggesting neutrophils as potential early predictors of lateral lymph node metastasis in PTC.

4,"Inhibition of nuclear factor-kappa B differentially affects thyroid cancer cell growth, apoptosis, and invasion Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is constitutively activated in many cancers and plays a key role in promoting cell proliferation, survival, and invasion. Our understanding of NF-κB signaling in thyroid cancer, however, is limited. In this study, we have investigated the role of NF-κB signaling in thyroid cancer cell proliferation, invasion, and apoptosis using selective genetic inhibition of NF-κB in advanced thyroid cancer cell lines. Three pharmacologic inhibitors of NF-κB differentially inhibited growth in a panel of advanced thyroid cancer cell lines, suggesting that these NF-κB inhibitors may have off-target effects. We therefore used a selective genetic approach to inhibit NF-κB signaling by overexpression of a dominant-negative IκBα (mIκBα). These studies revealed decreased cell growth in only one of five thyroid cancer cell lines (8505C), which occurred through a block in the S-G2/M transition. Resistance to TNFα-induced apoptosis was observed in all cell lines, likely through an NF-κB-dependent mechanism. Inhibition of NF-κB by mIκBα sensitized a subset of cell lines to TNFα-induced apoptosis. Sensitive cell lines displayed sustained activation of the stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) pathway, defining a potential mechanism of response. Finally, NF-κB inhibition by mIκBα expression differentially reduced thyroid cancer cell invasion in these thyroid cancer cell lines. Sensitive cell lines demonstrated approximately a two-fold decrease in invasion, which was associated with differential expression of MMP-13. MMP-9 was reduced by mIκBα expression in all cell lines tested. These data indicate that selective inhibition of NF-κB represents an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of advanced thyroid. However, it is apparent that global regulation of thyroid cancer cell growth and invasion is not achieved by NF-κB signaling alone. Instead, our findings suggest that other important molecular processes play a critical role in defining the extent of NF-κB function within cancer cells."
4,"METTL3 inhibition induced by M2 macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles drives anti-PD-1 therapy resistance via M6A-CD70-mediated immune suppression in thyroid cancer. The treatment options for advanced papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) refractory to standard therapies are limited. Although anti-PD-1 therapy has a manageable safety profile and has been effective in a small percentage of patients with advanced PTC and refractory ATC, the majority of the patients either do not respond or develop resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification is a critical determinant of the complexity of the tumor microenvironment (TME). However, it is unclear whether and how m6A modification in tumor cells shapes the immune landscape of PTC and ATC. In this study, we performed bulk and single cell RNA sequencing analysis of PTC and ATC tissues, and found that low METTL3 expression not only correlated to poor response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) but was also associated with increased TNF family-related ligand-receptor interactions in the immunosuppressive Tregs and exhausted T cells. Furthermore, overexpression of METTL3 in PTC and ATC cells enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell humanized NCG (huPBMC-NCG) mouse model. Mechanistically, M2 macrophage-derived extracellular vesicles (M2 EVs) inhibited METTL3 expression in PTC and ATC cells via miR-21-5p. Downregulation of METTL3 promoted demethylation of CD70 mRNA, which prevented YTHDF2-mediated degradation of the transcripts. The stabilization of CD70 mRNA, and the subsequent upregulation in CD70 protein levels increased the abundance of the immunosuppressive Tregs and terminally exhausted T cells, thereby inducing resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Furthermore, blocking CD70 using cusatuzumab, a high-affinity monoclonal antibody, reversed the anti-PD-1 therapy resistance induced by M2 EVs in vivo. Finally, we demonstrated that METTL3 expression negatively correlated with CD70 expression and M2 macrophages and Tregs infiltration in PTC and ATC tissues. Our findings provide new insights into developing novel therapies for advanced PTC and ATC."
4,"Residual Thyroid Tissue on Postoperative Diagnostic 131 I Radioactive Whole-Body Scan After Surgery in Differentiated Thyroid Cancer: A Tertiary Referral Centre Experience Residual thyroid tissue after total thyroidectomy in differentiated thyroid cancers is considered an independent risk factor for recurrence. Guidelines recommend following up patients after surgery with thyroglobulin (Tg), neck ultrasonography, and occasionally whole-body radioactive scan. However, the results of serum thyroglobulin and whole-body radioiodine scan are often discordant. The present study was undertaken to determine the levels of serum-stimulated thyroglobulin to complement the findings of residual thyroid tissue in the radioactive whole-body scan. One hundred twenty-six patients had undergone a radioiodine (131 I) whole-body scan (WBS) during the study duration, and 121 were available for analysis. The thyroglobulin level (measured by the CLIA method) was recorded at the time of these scans. The data was analysed to determine the level of stimulated thyroglobulin correlating with residual thyroid tissue, locoregional, and distant metastasis as assessed by WBS. The presence of residual thyroid tissue was noted in an overwhelmingly high 94% of cases. Twenty-four of the 28 patients with stimulated Tg < 2 ng/dl had residual thyroid tissue on a WBS. The discordancy rate (positive moderate — large WBS and negative serum thyroglobulin) of 64.28% was seen. Using ROC the serum thyroglobulin cut-offs levels for the loco-regional disease were found to be 27.705 ng/dl and 94.770 ng/dl for distant metastasis. The results highlight the fact that serum Tg levels cannot be used as an accurate predictor of the extent of the remnant thyroid tissue. Irrespective of the quality of surgery, which was analysed based on the centre and surgical specialty, over 90% of cases had residual thyroid tissue on WBS. The use of only stimulated Tg levels for follow-up may be inaccurate. Serum Tg is a useful test along with radioactive whole-body scans to distinguish local disease, loco-regional disease, and distant metastasis."

4,"Lymph node and distant metastases of thyroid gland cancer. Metastases in the thyroid glands The different biological features of the various major entities of thyroid cancer, e.g. papillary, follicular, poorly differentiated, anaplastic and medullary, depend to a large extent on their different metastatic spread. Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) has a propensity for cervical lymphatic spread that occurs in 20-50 % of patients whereas distant metastasis occurs in < 5 % of cases. Cervical lymphadenopathy may be the first symptom particularly of (micro) PTC. In contrast follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) has a marked propensity for vascular but not lymphatic invasion and 10-20 % of FTC develop distant metastases. At the time of diagnosis approximately one third of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) cases show lymph node metastases, in 10-15 % distant metastases and 25 % develop metastases during the course of the disease. Poorly differentiated (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) spread via both lymphatic and vascular invasion. Thus distant metastases are relatively uncommon in DTC and when they occur, long-term stable disease is the typical clinical course. The major sites of distant metastases are the lungs and bone. Metastases to the brain, breasts, liver, kidneys, muscle and skin are relatively rare or even rare. The thyroid gland itself can be a site of metastases from a variety of other tumors. In autopsy series of patients with disseminated cancer disease, metastases to the thyroid gland were found in up to 10 % of cases. Metastases from other primary tumors to the thyroid gland have been reported in 1.4-3 % of patients who have surgery for suspected cancer of the thyroid gland. The most common primary cancers that metastasize to the thyroid gland are renal cell (48.1 %), colorectal (10.4 %), lung (8.3 %) and breast cancer (7.8 %) and surprisingly often sarcomas (4.0 %)."
4,"Thyroid cancer incidence in cohorts exposed in childhood to 131I released during the Windscale nuclear reactor accident at Sellafield, England, in 1957. A fire in one of the Windscale nuclear reactors at Sellafield (Cumbria, England) in October 1957 released 1,800 TBq of <sup>131</sup>I (half-life, 8 days) to atmosphere. Measurements of <sup>131</sup>I activity in thyroids of exposed children showed typical thyroid doses of tens of milligray, but with some exceeding 100 mGy. Radiation exposure in childhood is known to increase the risk of thyroid cancer. Consequently, an investigation was conducted into whether raised numbers of thyroid cancer cases occurred in those exposed to <sup>131</sup>I as young children in Cumbria. A database of Cumbrian births from 1950 onwards allowed cohorts of 56,086 births during 1950-1958 and 137,444 births during 1959-1980 to be constructed, periods including children potentially exposed and unexposed, respectively, to <sup>131</sup>I. Three areas of Cumbria with different <sup>131</sup>I contamination levels were identified from monitoring data, and births assigned to these three areas for the two periods of birth. Members of these six sub-cohorts were linked to incident thyroid cancer cases in Great Britain during 1981-2020 using national cancer registration databases, providing thyroid cancer incidence rates. Incidence rate ratios (IRRs), with the lowest contamination area as a reference, were computed. No IRR differed discernibly from unity. For births during 1950-1958, the IRR for the combined highest and intermediate <sup>131</sup>I contamination areas was 0.68 (95% confidence interval: 0.24, 1.56), and no case of thyroid cancer was found in the small cohort born in the highest contamination area. In conclusion, no increased risk of thyroid cancer in those exposed to <sup>131</sup>I as young children in Cumbria in 1957 was detected. This study adds to the evidence on the long-term risk of thyroid cancer following childhood exposure to low and moderate levels of <sup>131</sup>I, such as occurred following the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011."
4,"Palate invasion in cT3/4 maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma: a study of at least 5-year follow-up. Background The prognostic significance of palate invasion in cT3/4N0 maxillary sinus squamous cell carcinoma (MS-SCC) remains ambiguous. This study endeavors to elucidate the impact of palate invasion on the prognosis of cT3/4N0 MS-SCC and to ascertain whether diverse neck management strategies modulate this effect. Methods A retrospective analysis was undertaken on a cohort of patients with surgically managed cT3/4N0 MS-SCC, all of whom had a minimum follow-up period of 5 years. The influence of palate invasion on locoregional control (LRC) and overall survival (OS) was scrutinized using the Cox proportional hazards model. Additionally, the relationship between palate invasion and occult metastasis was evaluated through logistic regression analysis. Results The study encompassed 133 patients, among whom 39 (29.3%) exhibited palate invasion. Elective neck dissection was performed in 58 patients, while the remaining subjects received elective neck irradiation. The Cox model for LRC revealed that patients with palate invasion faced a significantly elevated risk of locoregional recurrence (HR: 1.47; 95%CI: 1.17–1.90) compared to those without palate invasion. Similarly, the hazard ratio for palate invasion in the OS model was 1.64 (95%CI: 1.20–1.98), indicating a significantly poorer prognosis in cases with palate invasion. Both elective neck dissection and elective neck irradiation demonstrated comparable LRC and OS outcomes in patients with and without palate invasion. Occult metastasis was detected in 12 patients, and those with palate invasion exhibited nearly a one-fold increase in the risk of lymph node (LN) metastasis (OR: 1.68; 95%CI: 1.24–3.11) relative to those without palate invasion. Conclusion Palate invasion exerts a significantly adverse effect on both occult metastasis and overall prognosis. However, its influence on prognosis appears to be mitigated when elective neck dissection or elective neck irradiation is employed, suggesting a limited impact under these management strategies."
4,"Thyroid disease and cancer in kidney transplantation: a single-center analysis Thyroid diseases are frequent in patients with end-stage renal disease, but data on renal transplant recipients are conflicting. This study evaluated the incidence of thyroid disease and cancer in a population of kidney transplant recipients performed in a single center. Seven hundred sixty patients receiving a kidney transplantation between January 2000 and October 2017 were followed with thyroid ultrasonography to determine nodules together with thyroid hormone levels. Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration citology (FNAc) was performed to the nodules > 10 mm . Two hundred four patients (26.8%) patients demonstrated functional or morphologic changes in the thyroid gland compared with pre-transplant period. Among the 204 patients with newly diagnosed thyroid disease, 165 patients had single or multiple nodular lesions less than 1 cm in diameter, and were followed yearly. Nodule size progression was observed in 23 patients (13.9%), and they underwent a FNAc. A total of sixty-two patients (30.3%) underwent FNAc. The biopsy samples were cytologically interpreted as benign in 20 patients (32.2%), suspicious in 40 patients (64.5%), or at high risk of cancer in 2 patients (3.2%). Forty-two patients underwent total thyroidectomy. At histological examination, 18 patients had a thyroid cancer (papillary cancer in 17 patients, follicular cancer in one). Thyroid cancer was more frequent in male patients with a mean time from transplant to diagnosis of 5.6 years. At a mean follow-up was 8 ± 1.2 years, all patients are alive with a normal functioning graft. Thyroid diseases are common in transplant recipients. Thyroid disease may evolve after transplantation, probably as a consequence of immunosuppression. A complete evaluation of thyroid disease is mandatory in kidney transplant recipients because early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of thyroid disease and cancer may significantly decrease the morbidity and mortality in these patients."
4,"Evidence of increased chromosomal abnormalities in French Polynesian thyroid cancer patients The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities in thyroid cancer patients before and after radioactive iodine administration in order to assess cytogenetic particularity in Polynesian thyroid cancer patients. Chromosomal abnormalities were studied in 30 Polynesian patients with differentiated thyroid cancer, prior to and 4 days after 131I administration. Unstable chromosomal abnormalities were counted in peripheral blood lymphocytes using a conventional cytogenetic method. Peripheral blood was irradiated in vitro at different doses (0.5, 1 and 2 Gy) in order to establish the dose-response of the lymphocytes. Control groups were composed of 50 European thyroid cancer patients before and after first administration of 131I, and of ten European healthy donors. In addition, in vitro irradiation assays were performed at different doses (0.5, 1 and 2 Gy). The relative risk of spontaneous dicentrics before any radiation treatment was 2.9 (95% CI 1.7–5.1) times higher among Polynesian thyroid patients than among European thyroid cancer patients. After in vitro irradiation, the rise in frequency of dicentrics was similar in the Polynesian thyroid cancer group and the European thyroid patients and healthy donors. Four days after administration of 3.7 GBq 131I, the relative risk for a dicentric per cell was 1.3 (95% CI 1.0–1.5) times higher in Polynesian than in European patients. This can be explained by higher 131I retention in Polynesian compared with European patients. The results obtained revealed an increased frequency of cytogenetic abnormalities in Polynesian thyroid cancer patients compared with European control patients. These preliminary findings are compatible with possible previous environmental aggression and therefore imply a need for further investigations on larger series including, in particular, French Polynesian healthy donors. In addition to French Polynesians, Maori and Hawaiian control groups could be useful."
4,"Can computed tomography scanning in adults lead to an increased risk of thyroid cancer? A nationwide nested case-control study. To evaluate the association between computed tomography (CT) scanning and newly diagnosed thyroid cancer cases in relation to the confounding effect of the healthcare utilization rate. This nested case–control study used the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort 2002–2015: 3557 adult thyroid cancer cases were matched to 17,785 controls by age, sex, and diagnosis date. Odds ratios (ORs) were estimated for thyroid cancer associated with cumulative exposure to CT scanning > 3 years before cancer diagnosis. Changes in estimated ORs with and without adjustment for outpatient visit frequency were investigated. ORs for newly diagnosed thyroid cancer increased according to the higher number of total CT scans and thyroid-exposing CT scans (CT scans of the head, neck, or chest compartment; OR and 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09 [1.03–1.16] and 1.28 [1.05–1.57], respectively). ORs for thyroid cancer increased according to higher outpatient visit frequency. The association between thyroid cancer incidence and CT scans became insignificant when outpatient visit frequency was adjusted in the models (OR [95% CI], 1.03 [0.97–1.10]: total CT scans, 1.14 [0.93–1.41]: thyroid-exposing CT scans). Subgroup analyses stratified by age, sex, and history of other malignancies did not reveal independent associations between CT scanning and thyroid cancer. The high incidence of thyroid cancer in adults exposed to ionizing radiation during CT scanning can be largely explained by the confounding effect of the healthcare utilization rate. These effects should be considered to avoid overestimation of the CT scanning–associated risk of thyroid cancer. • Studies indicate that diagnostic imaging using low-ionizing radiation may increase risks for thyroid cancer in adults. • Our findings suggest that the risk for radiation-induced thyroid cancer following CT scanning in adults may have been overestimated in observational studies due to medical surveillance–related biases."
4,"Synergistic effect of metformin and vemurufenib (PLX4032) as a molecular targeted therapy in anaplastic thyroid cancer: an in vitro study. Survival rate of patients affected with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) is less than 5% with current treatment. In ATC, BRAFV600E mutation is the major mutation that results in the transformation of normal cells in to an undifferentiated cancer cells via aberrant molecular signaling mechanisms. Although vemurufenib is a selective oral drug for the BRAFV600E mutant kinase with a response rate of nearly 50% in metastatic melanoma, our study has showed resistance to this drug in ATC. Hence the rationale of the study is to explore combinational therapeutic effect to improve the efficacy of vemurafenib along with metformin. Metformin, a diabetic drug is an AMPK activator and has recently proved to be involved in preventing or treating several types of cancer. Using iGEMDock software, a protein–ligand interaction was successful between Metformin and TSHR (receptor present in the thyroid follicular cells). Our study demonstrates that combination of vemurufenib with metformin has synergistic anti-cancer effects which was evaluated through MTT assay (cytotoxicity), colony formation assay (antiproliferation evaluation) and suppressed the progression of ATC cells growth by inducing significant apoptosis, proven by Annexin V-FITC assay (Early Apoptosis Detection). Downregulation of ERK signaling, upregulation of AMPK pathway and precision in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway which were assessed by RT-PCR and Western blot provide the evidence that the combination of drugs involved in the precision of altered molecular signaling Further our results suggest that Metformin act as a demethylating agent in anaplastic thyroid cancer cells by inducing the expression of NIS and TSHR. Our study for the first time explored cAMP signaling in ATC wherein cAMP signaling is downregulated due to decrease in intracellular cAMP level upon metformin treatment. To conclude, our findings demonstrate novel therapeutic targets and treatment strategies for undifferentiated ATC."

4,"The acceleration in papillary thyroid cancer incidence rates is similar among racial and ethnic groups in the United States. Reports of similar age-specific incidence rates and a female-to-male gender disparity by racial/ethnic groups suggests that further consideration of race-specific patterns may confer insight into the possible causes of thyroid cancer or explanations for the increase in incidence. We used the National Cancer Institute’s (NCIs) surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) program and Joinpoint Regression for cases diagnosed during 1992–2009 to investigate trends and rates of acceleration for papillary thyroid cancer by gender and race/ethnicity. We determined the annual percent change (APC) and found a yearly increase of 7.0 % for papillary thyroid cancer for the most recent APC trend, with an APC of 6.3 and 7.1 % for white males and females, respectively; an APC of 4.3 and 8.4 % for black males and females, respectively; an APC of 4.2 and 6.7 % for Hispanic males and females, respectively; and an APC of 3.4 and 6.4 % in Asian/PI males and females, respectively. The APC projections show the rates of papillary thyroid cancer rising in males, but the patterns are more dramatic in females, with rates of papillary thyroid cancer in females surpassing rates of common cancers and becoming the third most common cancer in women of all ages by 2019. Although the lowest rates of thyroid cancer are observed in blacks, the greatest rate of acceleration is occurring in black females. Our data also show that the rate of papillary thyroid cancer will continue to surpass rates of ovarian cancer, and in white women: it is projected to be more incident than colorectal cancer as well; and in Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander women, rates of papillary thyroid cancer are projected to be higher than lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancers in the near future."
4,"Are endogenously lower serum thyroid hormones new predictors for thyroid malignancy in addition to higher serum thyrotropin It is well known that TSH plays a major role in the secretion of thyroid hormones, maintenance of thyroid specific gene expression, and gland growth. In this study, we aimed to evaluate association between tests of thyroid functions (fT3, fT4, TSH) and differentiated thyroid carcinoma. 441 patients operated for nodular goiter between 2005 and 2008 were analyzed. Thyroid functions were studied in the period of 1-30 days prior to surgery. In postoperative histopathological examination, differentiated thyroid carcinoma and benign thyroid disease were detected in 166 (37.6%) and 275 (62.4%) patients, respectively. Patients with thyroid malignancy had significantly lower serum fT3 (P = 0.001), lower fT4 (P = 0.022), and higher TSH levels (P < 0.001) compared to patients with benign disease, although all analytes were within the normal range. We subdivided by quartile serum fT3, fT4, and TSH in normal limits into three groups. The odds ratio (ORs) for the risk of thyroid cancer with a serum TSH between 0.63 and 1.67 μIU/ml and 1.68-4.00 μIU/ml, compared with a serum TSH between 0.40 and 0.62 μIU/ml were calculated as 2.60 (95% CIs 1.49-4.54) and 6.50 (95% CIs 3.51-12.03), respectively. There was also a greater risk of thyroid cancer in patients with fT3 levels of 1.57-3.00 pg/ml, compared with patients with fT3 levels of 3.89-4.71 pg/ml (OR 2.95, 95% CIs 1.68-5.20). For fT4, OR for the risk of thyroid cancer between 0.85 and 1.17 ng/dl compared with 1.48-1.78 ng/dl was 2.14 (95% CIs 1.22-3.74). In conclusion, lower fT3, fT4, and higher TSH concentrations within normal limits were related with increased thyroid cancer independent from sex and nodule type. Particularly, the association between lower fT3, fT4 levels and a diagnosis of thyroid cancer is a novel finding."
4,"Tangeretin induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in thyroid cancer cells. Thyroid cancer is a malignant tumor whose incidence is increasing worldwide. While thyroid cancer is treatable and curable, a small number of cases can become metastatic when cancer cells originating in the thyroid gland spread to other parts of the body through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. The most common treatments for thyroid cancer are resection and radioactive iodine therapy. However, these treatments have side effects, such as hypothyroidism and damage to normal non-cancerous cells. Tangeretin is a polymethoxylated flavone found in the peel of citrus plants and has biological activity, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects. However, the effects of tangeretin on human thyroid cancer have not been investigated. In this study, the effects of tangeretin on cell proliferation and apoptosis of the thyroid cancer cell line SNU-790 were investigated. To prove the results of this study, A water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST) assay, cell cycle arrest assay, annexin V/PI, DCF-DA, JC-10, and western blot were used. Treatment with tangeretin decreased SNU-790 cell viability and proliferation ability. Annexin V/PI staining showed that tangeretin increased apoptotic cell death. In the wound healing assay, the tangeretin treatment decreased the wound closure area. In addition, tangeretin treatment increased the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the cytosolic of SNU-790. The JC-10 assay showed that the tangeretin treatment decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Western blot analysis revealed that treatment with tangeretin increased the expression of the tumor protein p53. In conclusion, these results indicated that tangeretin inhibited the progression of thyroid cancer in SNU-790 cells by inhibiting migration ability, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction, and mediating oxidative stress in SNU-790. Hence, this study provides experimental evidence that tangeretin could be a potential candidate for the management of thyroid cancer."
4,"Investigating the demographic characteristics and pathological manifestations of thyroid Cancer during the last two decades (1997–2017) in patients referred to Baqiyatallah hospital, Tehran, Iran Thyroid cancer is among the most common endocrine cancers, and its incidence in our country is in progress over the past decades. This aggravates the necessity to evaluate the changes in thyroid cancer. Through accessing the information of the records of all patients with a diagnosis of thyroid cancer between 1996 and 2017, the present study was conducted at Baqiyatallah Hospital (Tehran, Iran) according to scientific criteria. After the diagnosis, most of them also underwent surgery and were evaluated in terms of the rate of the involvement and the type of thyroid cancer, and the pathology report was recorded in their records. Information about the intended patients such as age, gender, pathologic type of cancer, associated with the patient (except thyroid cancer), and history of radiation to the patient were recorded in a standard form and subjected to statistical analysis. Demographic changes and pathological manifestations of cancers in the two decades (1997–2007) and (2007–2017) were compared. But comparisons have been made over five years. The incidence of thyroid cancer, especially papillary thyroid cancer type, was increasing at an early age, and the incidence of tumor size measuring 2–4 cm was rising. But the incidence of tumor sizes less than one centimeter declined. The amount of vascular and capsule involvement was about 3 times, and lymph node involvement was nearly 2 times. The increasing incidence of 2–4 cm tumor size in the age group of 20–50 years was more than other age groups. The incidence of thyroid cancer was increasing at an early age, and the enhancement of papillary thyroid type was higher than other types. As well as, in this study, it was found that the incidence of 2–4 cm tumor sizes was rising."
4,"Prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with newly evaluated papillary thyroid cancer Background: This study investigates whether diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for the development of papillary thyroid cancer, using an age-, gender-, and race-matched analysis. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 1559 patients with newly evaluated thyroid cancer over a 4-year period at our institution and identified 1313 patients (84%) with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Characteristics of patients with diabetes versus those without diabetes were compared with a chi-square test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test for numeric variables. The prevalence of diabetes among patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma at our institution was compared (using an age-, gender-, and race-matched analysis) with that expected based on data from the continuous National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from the same time period. Results: For patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma, the median age was 47 years; 74% were female; 83% were white; and the prevalence of diabetes was 8%. Among those with diabetes, 92% had type 2 diabetes, and 24% were treated with insulin. Risk factors for diabetes included age and race. The prevalence of diabetes among patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma of all ages versus that among patients from NHANES of all ages was not significantly different (RR 1.07, CI 0.88 - 1.28). The prevalence of diabetes among patients with papillary thyroid cancer who were 44 years of age or younger versus that among patients from NHANES who were 44 years of age or younger, however, was significantly increased (RR 2.32, CI 1.37 - 3.66). There was no significant difference when subgroup analysis was performed by gender or race. Conclusions: We found an increased prevalence of diabetes in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma who were 44 years of age or younger."
4,"Incidence of Persistence and Recurrence of Differentiated Thyroid Cancer in Post-surgical Cases From a Tertiary Care Hospital in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Background Despite the excellent prognosis of differentiated thyroid carcinoma, recurrence remains a major concern. However, the persistence of thyroid cancer post-thyroidectomy is not uncommon. We aimed to characterise patients who underwent re-operative surgery for differentiated thyroid carcinoma and analyse the percentage of re-operations that truly were for ""recurrent"" disease versus the management of persistent disease. Methods We conducted a retrospective review of the hospital database, analysing patients who visited the nuclear medicine department at Mediclinic City Hospital, a tertiary care hospital in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, between 2015 and 2022. The study included patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma who underwent re-operations after total thyroidectomy. Recurrence was defined as the development of disease after a patient had undetectable thyroglobulin and negative radiological scans within one year of the first surgery. Cases were categorised as ""recurrent"", ""persistent"", or ""unable to classify"" in the event of missing data. Results Out of 836 patients diagnosed with differentiated thyroid carcinoma who visited the nuclear medicine department, 71 underwent re-operations. The mean age of these patients was 44.4 years (CI 41.7-47.0), of whom 78.9% were females. Almost half (46.5%) underwent re-operations within the first year, and 98.6% were diagnosed with papillary thyroid carcinoma. We were able to classify 63.4% of cases (n=45) as persistent disease, while 24 cases were categorised as ""unable to classify"". Only two cases met the criteria for recurrent disease. Conclusion The majority of cases previously classified as ""recurrent"" in differentiated thyroid carcinoma were found to be a persistent disease, possibly indicating inadequate therapy. Further research may be required to explore the reasons behind this eye-opening rate of disease persistence. This highlights an area for improvement in the management and future outcomes of differentiated thyroid carcinoma patients."

4,"Thyroid cancer complicating familial adenomatous polyposis: mutation spectrum of at-risk individuals Lifetime risk of thyroid cancer associated with FAP has been reported as 1-2%. The mean age at diagnosis of thyroid carcinoma in FAP has been reported at 28 years. The aims of this paper are to better understand gene mutations associated with thyroid cancer and refine surveillance recommendations for patients with FAP. We performed a search in Pubmed, Ovid Medline and Embase with the terms (""Thyroid Gland""[Mesh] OR ""Thyroid Neoplasms""[Mesh]) AND ""Adenomatous Polyposis Coli""[Meshdenomatous Polyposis Coli""[Mesh] to identify subjects with thyroid cancer and FAP. As a reference group for APC mutations in the unselected FAP population, we used the UMD-APC database referenced in the Orphanet portal, which includes APC mutation data on 2040 individuals with FAP. There were 115 reported cases of thyroid cancer in patients with FAP (95 female: 11 male) with an average age of 29.2 years. Gene mutation testing results were reported in 48 patients. On comparing the prevalence of APC mutation in the population of FAP patients with thyroid cancer and the prevalence of the same mutation in the reference population an increased odds ratio was evident in individuals harboring an APC mutation at codon 1061 (OR: CI 4.1: 1.7-8.9). Analysis of the prevalence of thyroid cancer in individuals with FAP segregated by the region of the gene affected shows an increased risk of thyroid cancer in individuals harboring mutations proximal to codon 512 (OR 2.6, p 0.0099). There is increased risk for thyroid cancer in individuals with APC mutations at the 5' end (proximal to codon 528) along with the established high risk group harboring mutation at codon 1061. It is suggested that these patients might benefit from directed surveillance by annual ultrasound from age 18 years onwards."

We conducted a retrospective review of adult survivors of childhood and young adult cancer with a history of neck radiation followed in the Adult Long-Term Follow-Up Clinic at Memorial Sloan Kettering between November 2005 and August 2014. Eligible patients underwent a physical exam of the thyroid and were followed for at least 1 year afterwards. Ineligible patients were those with prior diagnosis of benign or malignant thyroid nodules. During a median follow-up of 3.1 years (range 0–9.4 years), 106 ultrasounds and 2277 physical exams were performed among 585 patients. Forty survivors had an abnormal thyroid physical exam median of 21 years from radiotherapy; 50% of those with an abnormal exam were survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, 60% had radiation at ages 10–19, and 53% were female. Ultimately, 24 underwent fine needle aspiration (FNA). Surgery revealed papillary carcinoma in seven survivors; six are currently free of disease and one with active disease is undergoing watchful waiting. Among those with one or more annual visits, representing 1732 person-years of follow-up, no cases of thyroid cancer were diagnosed within a year of normal physical exam. These findings support the application of annual physical exam without routine ultrasound for thyroid cancer screening among survivors with a history of neck radiation. Survivors with a history of neck radiation may not require routine thyroid ultrasound for thyroid cancer screening. Among adult survivors of childhood and young adult cancer with a history of radiation therapy to the neck, annual physical exam is an acceptable thyroid cancer screening strategy."
4,"Thyroid cancer risk in Belarus after the Chernobyl accident: comparison with external exposures. Within the time period 1990–1993, childhood thyroid cancer incidence due to the Chernobyl accident increased dramatically in Belarus, especially with regard to the birth cohort January 1, 1971, to May 31, 1986. This rise subsequently slowed down, i.e. during the period 1994–1996. The respective data were analysed and compared with the results of an analysis on the time dependence of thyroid cancer incidence in a pooled cohort of persons who had been exposed during childhood to external radiation with high dose rates. Concerning the period of 5–10 years following exposure, the excess absolute cancer risk per unit thyroid dose in the latter (external) exposure group was found to exceed the one in the Belarus group by a factor of two. This difference, however, is not statistically significant. The age-adjusted average excess absolute risk per unit thyroid dose for the period of 5–50 years following external childhood exposure was found to be 8 female and 14 male cases per 104 person-year · Gy, which is a factor about 2.5 times higher than for the non-adjusted risk in the pooled cohort, as reported by Ron et al. in 1995. Assessments of future excess thyroid cancer cases due to the Chernobyl accident were done on the basis of the time dependence of thyroid cancer risk following external exposure. The thyroid cancer incidence among the birth cohort considered in Belarus and for a period starting from the cessation of the available observation data (1 January 1997) and extending to 50 years after the Chernobyl accident has been estimated to be about 15,000 cases, with an uncertainty range of 5000–45,000 cases. According to our calculations, 80% of these cases exceed the baseline risk under enhanced thyroid surveillance."

Observational studies cannot recognize whether thyroid cancer is independently associated with kidney disease. We performed the Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to genetically investigate the causality of thyroid cancer on immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN).</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">We explored the causal effect of thyroid cancer on IgAN by MR analysis. Fifty-two genetic loci and single nucleotide polymorphisms were related to thyroid cancer. The primary approach in this MR analysis was the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method, and MR‒Egger was the secondary method. Weighted mode and penalized weighted median were used to analyze the sensitivity. In this study, the random-effect IVW models showed the causal impact of genetically predicted thyroid cancer across the IgAN risk (OR, 1.191; 95% CI, 1.131-1.253, P &lt; 0.001). Similar results were also obtained in the weighted mode method (OR, 1.048; 95% CI, 0.980-1.120, P = 0.179) and penalized weighted median (OR, 1.185; 95% CI, 1.110-1.264, P &lt; 0.001). However, the MR‒Egger method revealed that thyroid cancer decreased the risk of IgAN, but this difference was not significant (OR, 0.948; 95% CI, 0.855-1.051, P = 0.316). The leave-one-out sensitivity analysis did not reveal the driving influence of any individual SNP on the association between thyroid cancer and IgAN.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">The IVW model indicated a significant causality of thyroid cancer with IgAN. However, MR‒Egger had a point estimation in the opposite direction.

4,"Novel targeted therapies and immunotherapy for advanced thyroid cancers Thyroid cancer is a frequently encountered endocrine malignancy. Despite the favorable prognosis of this disease, 15–20% of differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) cases and most anaplastic types, remain resistant to standard treatment options, including radioactive iodine (RAI). In addition, around 30% of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) cases show resistance after surgery. The evolving understanding of disease-specific molecular therapeutic targets has led to the approval of two targeted therapies (Sorafenib and Lenvatinib) for RAI refractory DTC and another two drugs (Vandetanib and Cabozantinib) for MTC. These advanced therapies exert their effects by blocking the MAPK pathway, which has been widely correlated to different types of thyroid cancers. While these drugs remain reserved for thyroid cancer patients who failed all treatment options, their ability to improve patients’ overall survival remain hindered by their low efficacy and other molecular factors. Among these factors is the tumor’s ability to activate parallel proliferative signaling pathways other than the cascades blocked by these drugs, along with overexpression of some tyrosine kinase receptors (TKR). These facts urge the search for novel different treatment strategies for advanced thyroid cases beyond these drugs. Furthermore, the growing knowledge of the dynamic immune system interaction with tumor microenvironment has revolutionized the cancer immune therapy field. In this review, we aim to discuss the molecular escape mechanisms of thyroid tumors from these drugs. We also highlight novel therapeutic options targeting other pathways than MAPK, including PI3K pathway, ALK translocations and HER2/3 receptors and their clinical impact. We also aim to discuss the usage of targeted therapy in restoring thyroid tumor sensitivity to RAI, and finally turn to extensively discuss the role of immunotherapy as a potential alternative treatment option for advanced thyroid diseases."
4,"The functions and prognostic values of m6A RNA methylation regulators in thyroid carcinoma. Background N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) is the most common RNA modification and regulates RNA splicing, translation, translocation, and stability. Aberrant expression of m6A has been reported in various types of human cancers. m6A RNA modification is dynamically and reversibly mediated by different regulators, including methyltransferase, demethylases, and m6A binding proteins. However, the role of m6A RNA methylation regulators in thyroid cancer remains unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of the 13 main m6A RNA modification regulators in thyroid carcinoma. Methods We obtained clinical data and RNA sequencing data of 13 m6A RNA methylation regulators from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) THCA database. We performed consensus clustering to identify the clinical relevance of m6A RNA methylation regulators in thyroid carcinoma. Then we used LASSO Cox regression analysis to generate a prognostic signature based on m6A RNA modification regulator expression. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, Gene Ontology and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses were performed to explore differential cellular processes and signaling pathways between the two groups based on risk signature. Results We found that most of the m6A RNA modification regulators are down-regulated in 450 patients with thyroid carcinoma. We derived a three m6A RNA modification regulator genes-based risk signature (FTO, RBM15 and KIAA1429), that is an independent prognostic biomarker in patients with thyroid carcinoma. Moreover, we found that this risk signature could better predict outcome in male than female. Functional research in vitro demonstrated that the m6A RNA methylation regulators involved in the model acted significant role in the proliferation and migration of thyroid cancer cells. Conclusions Our study revealed the influence of m6A RNA methylation regulators on thyroid carcinoma through biological experiments and three-gene prognostic model."
4,"Consequences of atmospheric contamination by radioiodine: the Chernobyl and Fukushima accidents. After the accidents of nuclear power plants at Chernobyl and at Fukushima, huge amounts of radioactive iodine were released into the atmosphere. We reviewed data on the health consequences of these accidents with a focus on thyroid consequences. Among the 2 million children who were living in highly contaminated regions in Belarus, Ukraine and Russia, 7000 cases of thyroid cancer had occurred in 2005. This is the most significant radiation-induced consequence of the Chernobyl accident. The increased incidence of thyroid cancer observed in adult population who lived in these highly contaminated regions is at least in major part related to screening and it is not possible to individualize among these thyroid cancers those that are potentially caused by radiation exposure. For populations who lived outside these regions at the time of the accident, there is no detectable consequence of the radiation exposure on the thyroid gland. Among children who lived nearby the Fukushima power plant in 2011, there is currently no evidence of an increased incidence of thyroid cancer. Ultrasonography screening in these individuals detected a number of thyroid cancers that are probably not related to the accident. Because thyroid cancer is frequent, studies have been carried out to distinguish radiation-induced from their sporadic counterparts, and genomic signatures might be helpful. The consequences of the Chernobyl accident clearly demonstrate that populations living nearby a nuclear power plant should be protected in case of accident by sheltering, food restrictions and prophylaxis of thyroid irradiation by potassium iodine administration, if the predicted estimated dose to the thyroid gland of children might be >50 mGy. These countermeasures should be applied in priority to children, adolescents and pregnant women; they are safe and effective."
4,"Thyroid Cancer in Ecuador, a 16 years population-based analysis (2001-2016). Thyroid cancer is the most frequent endocrine neoplasia worldwide. Information from Andean countries is scarce. In Ecuador there is no reports available of the epidemiology of this type of cancer. The aim of this study is to present the epidemiology and the burden of disease of thyroid cancer. This is a cross-sectional population-based analysis of thyroid cancer epidemiology in Ecuador from 2001 to 2016. The variables studied were the overall mortality rate, socio-demographics characteristics of the hospitalized patients, geographical trends and the burden of thyroid cancer in Ecuador. All the data was obtained from the official records reported by the Ministry of Public Health’s and retrieved from the public databases of the Vital Statistics Deaths and Births Databases and the National Institute of Census and Statistics (INEC). In Ecuador, over a period of 16 years from 2001 to 2016 a total of 23,632 hospital admissions were reported, which caused 1539 deaths due thyroid cancer. Data demonstrated an annual mean of 1477 cases, which caused 96 deaths per year in average. The annual incidence fluctuated from 3 in 2001 to 22 in 2016 per 100,000 inhabitants. Women were 5 times more likely than men to have thyroid cancer. The average length of stay for both sexes were 4 days. The mortality attributable to thyroid cancer represent less than 0.3% of all cancer deaths. Ecuador has one of the highest rates of thyroid cancer in Latin America, ranking first among women in Latin America. Although this cancer is frequent, mortality rate is relatively low. As this is the first national report of thyroid cancer in the country, a further analysis of the pathological variants and the grading of this neoplasia is needed."
4,"Reply to “Differences in the Impact of Age on Mortality in Well-Differentiated Thyroid Cancer” To the editors: We read with great interest the recent publication by Yan et al. 1 highlighting the important prognostic differences between follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) and the far more commonly encountered papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). FTC recurs rarely, but patients who have recurrences may die of metastatic disease in spite of otherwise favorable risk profiles. The different biology between the categories of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (i.e., PTC and FTC) is evident both clinically and in the laboratory. Furthermore, our group recently published a whole exome-sequencing analysis of FTC that mapped the genetic landscape of these tumors, with a particular emphasis on the infrequent widely invasive (WIFTC) subtype. 2 Of 10 WIFTC patients studied, 5 experienced recurrence and died of FTC within 10 years. Of 6 thyroid cancer-specific deaths in our overall FTC cohort of 39 cases, half were classified as stage I or II by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) eighth-edition staging system, mostly due to the increased age cutoff of 55 years. 3 Interestingly, we found that both genomic markers and traditional clinical and histopathologic factors predicted poor survival. Unfortunately, the degree of FTC invasion is not wellcaptured in the national cancer registries, so a large-scale analysis of these high-risk subgroups is not possible using these approaches. Prior studies have demonstrated the prognostic significance of the degree of invasion for FTC in smaller single-institution series. 4 Although the AJCC eighth-edition staging system provides accurate prognostic information for the vast majority of patients with welldifferentiated thyroid cancer, certain high-risk histologic or molecular features may outweigh traditional tumor-nodemetastasis (TNM) staging and should be considered when the risk of recurrence and death is evaluated for thyroid cancer patients."
4,"ID Proteins May Reduce Aggressiveness of Thyroid Tumors. ID genes have an important function in the cell cycle, and ID proteins may help identify aggressive tumors, besides being considered promising therapeutic targets. However, their role in thyroid tumors is still poorly understood. We examined ID expression and their correlation with diagnostic and prognostic features aiming to find a clinical application in differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) cases. mRNA levels of ID1, ID2, ID3, and ID4 genes were quantified and their expression was observed by immunohistochemistry in 194 thyroid samples including 68 goiters, 16 follicular adenomas, 75 classic papillary thyroid carcinomas, 18 follicular variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma, 5 follicular thyroid carcinomas, and 1 anaplastic thyroid cancer, besides 11 normal thyroid tissues. DTC patients were managed according to standard protocols and followed up for M = 28 ± 16 months. ID2, ID3, and ID4 mRNA levels were higher in benign (2.0 ± 1.9; 0.6 ± 0.6; and 0.7 ± 1.0 AU, respectively) than those in malignant nodules (0.30 ± 0.62; 0.3 ± 0.3; and 0.2 ± 0.3 AU, respectively, p < 0.0001 for all three genes) and were associated with no extra thyroid invasion or metastasis at diagnosis. ID3 nuclear protein expression was higher in benign than that in malignant cells (5.2 ± 0.9 vs 3.0 ± 1.8 AU; p < 0.0001). On the contrary, the cytoplasmic expression of ID3 was higher in malignant than that in benign lesions (5.7 ± 1.5 vs 4.0 ± 1.4 AU; p < 0.0001). Our data indicate that ID genes are involved in thyroid tumorigenesis and suggest these genes act impeding the evolution of more aggressive phenotypes. The different patterns of their tissue expression may help identify malignancy and characterize thyroid lesion aggressiveness."
4,"Thyroid Cancer Detection with Dual-isotope Parathyroid Scintigraphy in Primary Hyperparathyroidism Thyroid cancer cells have been shown to take up 99mTc-sestamibi. The role for 99mTc-sestamibi scintigraphy (Tc-MIBI) in the diagnosis of thyroid cancer in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is unclear. Our aim was to determine whether dual-isotope parathyroid scintigraphy is useful in identifying thyroid cancer. A prospective database of 3,187 patients who underwent neck exploration for PHPT was reviewed to identify patients who had concurrent thyroid resection. Patients with benign and malignant thyroid disease were comparatively analyzed. A total of 470 patients underwent both thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy (reoperations in 21%). Benign disease (n = 391, 83%) was more common than malignancy [papillary thyroid cancer (n = 75) and medullary thyroid cancer (n = 5); 1 had both]. Dual-isotope scintigraphy obtained in 374 patients (80%) had a sensitivity of 67% and a positive predictive value of 66% for parathyroid adenoma localization in these patients with thyroid disease. False-positive scintigraphy occurred in 22% with benign and 45% with malignant thyroid disease (P = 0.002). On Tc-MIBI imaging, 54 (86%) of 63 patients with malignancy had hot nodules, compared to 248 (81%) of 308 patients with benign disease (P = 0.49). On I-123 imaging, 34 (54%) of 63 patients with malignancy had cold nodules, compared to 42 (14%) of 304 patients with benign disease (P < 0.001). A dual-isotype phenotype of both Tc-MIBI-Hot and I-123-Cold had sensitivity 52%, specificity 88%, positive predictive value 47%, and negative predictive value 90% for detecting a thyroid malignancy. A Tc-MIBI-Hot/I-123-Cold phenotype is very specific for detecting thyroid malignancy. Patients with this imaging phenotype should strongly be considered for preoperative ultrasound-guided biopsy. Patients found intraoperatively to have false-positive parathyroid scintigraphy should be evaluated for thyroid cancer."

4,"Postoperative rehabilitation and quality of life evaluation for transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy vestibular approach. There are no targeted rehabilitation training modalities and assessment tools for patients after transoral endoscopic thyroidectomy vestibular approach (TOETVA). Herein, we develop a new assessment questionnaire and rehabilitation training modality and evaluate its safety and effectiveness. The THYCA-QoL-TOETVA questionnaire was compiled, and reliability and validity analyses were performed. Patients were divided into the new rehabilitation training group (N) or the conventional rehabilitation training group (C), and 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was performed after administering questionnaires to patients in both groups. Cervical range of motion (CROM) data were also measured and collected for statistical analysis. The questionnaire used in this study showed good expert authority, coordination, internal consistency, and questionnaire reliability. A total of 476 patients were included after PSM, and the questionnaire results showed that recovery and quality of life were better in the N group than in the C group (124.55 ± 8.171 vs. 122.94 ± 8.366, p = 0.026). Analysis of cervical spine mobility showed that rehabilitation was better in the N group compared to the C group at postoperative one month (flexion: 1.762°, extension: 4.720°, left lateral bending: 3.912°, right lateral bending: 4.061°, left axial rotation: 5.180°, right axial rotation: 5.199°, p value all of these < 0.001), and at postoperative three months (flexion: 2.866°, extension: 2.904°, left lateral bending: 3.927°, right lateral bending: 3.330°, left axial rotation: 4.395°, right axial rotation: 3.992°, p value all of these < 0.001). The THYCA-QoL-TOETVA provides an appropriate and effective tool for measuring the postoperative quality of life of TOETVA patients. This new rehabilitation training can effectively alleviate the problem of limited neck movement and improve the quality of life of patients after TOETVA surgery.Trial registration: ChiCTR2300069097."

4,"Decrease of prostaglandin I2 binding sites in thyroid cancer. The properties of specific prostaglandin I2 (prostacyclin, PGI2) binding sites in normal thyroid tissue have been characterised. Tissue samples obtained intraoperatively from patients with 'cold' solitary thyroid nodules (as preoperatively selected by thyroid gland scintigraphy, thyroid gland ultrasonography and Papanicolaou cytology following fine needle aspiration of the nodule area) have been used for thyroid membrane preparation. Employing [3H]iloprost, a chemically stable PGI2-analogue as a radioligand, saturation experiments for comparative binding studies have been attempted. Scatchard analysis of the binding data obtained for normal thyroid parenchyma distant to the nodule area revealed heterogeneity of the [3H]iloprost sites exhibiting a high-affinity binding capacity (Bmax) of 613.2 +/- 130.4 fmol mg-1 membrane protein and a low-affinity binding capacity of 5.1 +/- 1.6 pmol mg-1 membrane protein. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) amounted to 18.9 +/- 8.9 nM and to 131.5 +/- 39.2 nM, respectively. Scatchard analysis of the binding data obtained for benign thyroid adenoma indicated significant lower binding capacities exhibiting a Bmax of 325.8 +/- 110.0 fmol mg-1 membrane protein (Kd: 31.0 +/- 7.5 nM) for the high-affinity sites and of 3.9 +/- 2.5 pmol mg-1 membrane protein (Kd: 364.9 +/- 183.6) for the low affinity sites. In cancer tissue a selective loss of the low affinity sites and a significant diminution of the high-affinity sites was observed: in well differentiated cancer the high-affinity sites showed a Bmax of 299.7 +/- 46.0 fmol mg-1 membrane protein (Kd: 38.9 +/- 7.3 nM), in anaplastic cancer, less differentiated papillar and follicular cancers of 180.6 +/- 25.1 fmol mg-1 membrane protein (Kd: 54.6 +/- 16.7 nM).

The close relationship between IDO2 and CD4 + T cell infiltration in the MTC microenvironment, together with its potential prognostic implications, makes it possible for IDO2 to serve as an alternative drug target in cancer immunotherapy and as a new prognostic tool.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2022.

4,"Correlation of BRAF mutation and SUV max levels in thyroid cancer patients incidentally detected in 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography The prognostic importance of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose avidity in primary thyroid tumor and molecular basis responsible for its mechanism has not yet been well characterized. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the correlation between the maximum standardized uptake levels and B-type Raf kinase mutation positivity in incidentally detected papillary thyroid cancer patients during 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography examination. We retrospectively evaluated 6873 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography scans of consecutive subjects from a database search for tumor staging in 2014 at our hospital Nuclear Medicine Center. In total, 135 patients had focal 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake in the thyroid. Of these, 76 patients had fine-needle aspiration biopsy. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose–maximum standardized uptake of the positron emission tomography-detected nodules was recorded. B-type Raf kinase (V600E) mutation and p53 protein expression were evaluated in papillary thyroid cancer patients. The incidence of thyroid incidentaloma in 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose–maximum standardized uptake scans was 2 % (135/6873). Of the 76 patients evaluated, 41 % (n = 31) were diagnosed papillary thyroid cancer. B-type Raf kinase mutation was positive in 51 % (17/30) of the papillary thyroid cancer patients. Maximum standardized uptake levels of the nodules (≥1 cm) were significantly higher in B-type Raf kinase-mutated papillary thyroid cancer patients than in non-mutated patients [16.6 (10.4–27.9) vs. 9.7 (6.8–11.1); P = 0.007]. Correlation analysis revealed that maximum standardized uptake was significantly associated with B-type Raf kinase mutation positivity (r = 0.519; P = 0.005). Logistic regression analysis showed an association between maximum standardized uptake and B-type Raf kinase mutation positivity even after adjustment for age and gender (P = 0.01). B-type Raf kinase mutation is closely related to 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography maximum standardized uptake levels in patients with incidentally detected papillary thyroid cancer."
4,"Clinicopathological characteristics of thyroid cancer in the federal state of Salzburg The aim of our investigation was to evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics and mutation patterns in newly diagnosed cases of thyroid cancer in the federal state of Salzburg, Austria, in the year 2013. The medical records of all patients newly diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2013 in the federal state of Salzburg were retrospectively reviewed. The clinicopathological characteristics and mutations of thyroid cancers were analyzed. 63 patients (mean age: 51.0 years, range: 21–81 years; female 75%, male 25%) were identified. 53 patients had papillary (12 follicular variant), 4 patients follicular (1 oxyphilic variant), 3 patients medullary, and 3 patients anaplastic thyroid cancer. T1 tumors were found in 34 patients (pT1a, 20 patients; pT1b, 14 patients), T2 tumors in 10 patients, T3 tumors in 16 patients, and T4 tumors in 3 patients. Lymph node involvement was seen in 15 patients and metastatic disease in 1 patient. Mutations of BRAF (B-type Raf kinase) were detected in 23 and mutation of NRAS (Neuroblastoma RAS Viral Oncogene Homolog) in 2 papillary thyroid cancers. No concomitant mutations of BRAF and NRAS were found. Females accounted for 75% of the patients with newly diagnosed thyroid cancer and the incidence peaked at a younger age than in males. Papillary thyroid cancer was the most frequent tumor type, accounting for 84% of the cases. A high frequency of T1 tumors and cancers with no lymph node involvement was found. Males had a higher proportion of large tumors and more aggressive forms of thyroid cancer than females. Mutations (mostly of BRAF) were found in 47% of the cases. Neither mutations of KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue) nor concomitant mutations of BRAF and NRAS were found."

4,"Thyroid cancer: incidence and mortality trends in China, 2005–2015 Understanding secular trends of thyroid cancer is critical to plan strategies for cancer prevention and control. Our aim was to estimate the incidence and mortality trends of thyroid cancer in China during 2005–2015. A retrospective cohort evaluation of thyroid cancer cases and deaths during 2005–2015 was performed using population-based data from the Chinese Cancer Registry Annual Report. The incidence and mortality rates of thyroid cancer were stratified by gender, age group (0, 1–4, 5–9, 10–14…80–84, 85–), and area (urban or rural). A Joinpoint regression model was used to examine secular trends. In China, the age-standardized incidence was 3.21/105 in 2005, and increased to 9.61/105 in 2015. Besides, a significant increase incidence rate was observed with the average annual percent change (AAPC) of 12.4% (95% CI: 10.5%–14.4%) in the period 2005–2015. The age-standardized mortality was 0.30/105 in 2005 and 0.35/105 in 2015, and the AAPC was 2.9% (95% CI: 1.3%–4.5%). For both incidence and mortality, the rates of thyroid cancer were much higher in females than in males, and in urban areas rather than rural areas; however, the rates of increasing trends showed no significant differences. With respect to the highest age-specific rates, it appeared in the age group of 50–54 years old for incidence and in the age group of 80–84 years old for mortality. Notably, the rate of increasing incidence trend was lower in older age groups, especially for people aged 70–79 years old. A rapid increase in incidence and a moderate increase in mortality of thyroid cancer were observed from 2005 to 2015 in our study. Effective measures and tailored programs should be taken to curb the growth trend and reduce the disease burden."
4,"Outcome of thyroid ultrasound screening in FAP patients with a normal baseline exam Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a hereditary cancer syndrome associated with a substantial lifetime risk for colorectal cancer. The leading extra-colonic causes of cancer in FAP include duodenal and thyroid cancer (TC). Recent guidelines recommend annual thyroid ultrasound (TUS) screening beginning in the teenage years but the evidence to support the interval particularly in FAP patients with a normal baseline ultrasound is lacking. TUS results from FAP patients enrolled in a thyroid screening program from 2006 to 2016 and who had at least 2 TUS were reviewed. TUS findings were classified as normal, low (LR) or high risk (HR) for TC based on nodule characteristics as determined by American Thyroid Association (ATA) guidelines. We assessed the incidence of TC in patient with normal baseline TUS and factors associated with TC. 264 FAP patients were included. Baseline TUS was normal in 167, LR in 74, and HR in 24 patients. Patients were observed for a mean 4.8 years and underwent an average of 3 TUS. Patients with normal baseline TUS did not develop TC during the course of follow up of 5.1 years. TC developed in 6 patients (2.3%) all with baseline nodules; 5 in the LR group and 1 in the HR group. Factors associated with development of TC were presence of baseline nodule(s) and female sex. The development of TC in FAP patients in a TUS screening program with short term follow up is low and no FAP patient with a normal baseline TUS developed TC during observation. Annual TUS in patients with a normal baseline TUS may not be needed. Extending the screening interval to 2 years may be reasonable until nodules are detected."

4,"Regulatory role of Chitinase 3-like 1 gene in papillary thyroid carcinoma proved by integration analyses of single-cell sequencing with cohort and experimental validations. Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is one of the most common thyroid carcinomas. The gross extrathyroidal extension and extensive metastases of PTC lead to high rates of recurrence and poor clinical outcomes. However, the mechanisms underlying PTC development are poorly understood. In this study, using single-cell RNA sequencing, the transcriptome profiles of two PTC patients were addressed, including PTC1 with low malignancy and good prognosis and PTC2 with high malignancy and poor prognosis. We found that epithelial subcluster Epi02 was the most associated with the malignant development of PTC cells, with which the fold change of Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) is on the top of the differentially expressed genes between PTC1 and PTC2 (P < 0.001). However CHI3L1 is rarely investigated in PTC as far. We then studied its role in PTC with a series of experiments. Firstly, qRT-PCR analysis of 14 PTC patients showed that the expression of CHI3L1 was positively correlated with malignancy. In addition, overexpression or silencing of CHI3L1 in TPC-1 cells, a PTC cell line, cultured in vitro showed that the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of the cells were promoted or alleviated by CHI3L1. Further, immunohistochemistry analysis of 110 PTC cases revealed a significant relationship between CHI3L1 protein expression and PTC progression, especially the T (P < 0.001), N (P < 0.001), M stages (P = 0.007) and gross ETE (P < 0.001). Together, our results prove that CHI3L1 is a positive regulator of malignant development of PTC, and it promotes proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of PTC cells. Our study improves understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of PTC and provides new insights for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of PTC."
4,"Meeting report: the 5th International expert symposium in Fukushima on radiation and health. The symposium entitled “Chernobyl +30, Fukushima +5: Lessons and Solutions for Fukushima’s Thyroid Question” was held in September, 2016 in Fukushima. The aim of the Symposium was to revisit and recapitulate evidence from the studies in Chernobyl in order to share multidisciplinary opinions and views on the likely reason for the high rate of thyroid cancer detected by the Thyroid Ultrasound Examination program in Fukushima Prefecture. The high prevalence of thyroid cancer in young individuals causes concerns among Fukushima residents and the general public that it might be due to putative radiation exposure from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident. Twenty-six experts from Japan and abroad, including participants affiliated with international organizations, reviewed the results of radiation epidemiology investigations in Chernobyl, presented clinical experience of diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with radiation-related thyroid cancer, and scrutinized the findings on thyroid cancer in Fukushima. Conclusions drawn at the symposium included understanding that in contrast to Chernobyl, doses to the public from the accident in Fukushima were too low to give rise to a discernible excess risk for thyroid cancer. The high detection rate of thyroid cancer and benign abnormalities resulted from the use of highly sensitive ultrasound equipment and sophisticated protocol of examination used in the Thyroid Ultrasound Examination, and therefore not attributable to radiation. Coordinated efforts will be necessary to avoid overdiagnosis and overtreatment, which may carry its own health disbenefits. Clear communication to the screening participants and their families is recommended in regard to why the examination is being conducted and to explain the likely outcomes and risks, including the means and options for treatment if a thyroid disorder is detected."
4,"Biomarkers of thyroid function and autoimmunity for predicting high-risk groups of thyroid cancer: a nested case–control study A remarkable increase in the number of thyroid cancer cases has been reported in recent years; however, the markers to predict high-risk groups have not been fully established. We conducted a case–control study (257 cases and 257 controls) that was nested in the Cancer Screenee Cohort Study between August 2002 and December 2010; the mean follow-up time for this study was 3.1 ± 2.2 years. The levels of total triiodothyronine (TT3), free thyroxine (FT4), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroglobulin (Tg), anti-thyroperoxidase antibody (TPOAb), and anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) were measured using samples with pre-diagnostic status. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between thyroid function/autoimmunity and thyroid cancer risk. When the markers were categorized by the tertile distributions of the control group, the highest tertile of FT4 (OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.11 - 2.69) and the middle tertile of TSH (OR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.14 - 2.74) were associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer by multivariate analyses. In addition, an elevated risk for thyroid cancer was found in subjects with TPOAb levels above 30 IU/mL (OR = 8.47, 95% CI = 5.39 - 13.33 for 30–60 IU/mL and OR = 4.48, 95% CI = 2.59 - 7.76 for ≥60 IU/mL). Stratified analyses indicated that some of these associations differed by sex, BMI, smoking status, and the duration of follow-up. This study demonstrated that the levels of biomarkers of thyroid function/autoimmunity, particularly the presence of TPOAb, might be used as diagnostic markers for predicting thyroid cancer risk. Our findings suggest that careful monitoring of thyroid biomarkers may be helpful for identifying Korean populations at high-risk for thyroid cancer."

4,"Thyroid Dosimetry and Its Association With Radiation-Induced Hypothyroidism in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Treated With Conformal Radiotherapy: An Observational Study. Introduction Hypothyroidism is a common side effect in head and neck cancer (HNC) patients treated with radiotherapy (RT). Conformal RT reduces the dose to normal tissues while delivering higher doses to tumors. However, hypothyroidism remains a significant toxicity in these patients. This study evaluates the incidence of hypothyroidism, thyroid dosimetric parameters, and their correlation with radiation-induced hypothyroidism in HNC patients treated with conformal RT at a regional cancer center in India. Methods Fifty patients with histologically confirmed squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, treated with conformal RT, and who underwent pre- and post-treatment thyroid function tests were included in the study. All patients were euthyroid before treatment. The thyroid gland was contoured retrospectively in the approved RT plan. The volume of the contoured thyroid gland and the thyroid dosimetric parameters (Dmean, Dmax, Dmin, and V30-V60) were recorded. Pre- and post-treatment thyroid function test results were compared to look for the incidence of hypothyroidism, and dosimetric data were compared to establish a relation with the incidence of hypothyroidism. Results The median age was 53 years. Most patients had oral cavity primaries (60%), stage III/IVA disease (86%), and received definitive (64%) or adjuvant (36%) RT. Two-thirds underwent concurrent chemotherapy. After a median follow-up of four months, 24% developed hypothyroidism, with a median onset of 16 weeks post-treatment. Pharyngeal primary and concurrent chemotherapy were significant risk factors. Dosimetric analysis revealed Dmean > 57 Gy, V55 > 80%, and V60 > 37% as predictors of hypothyroidism. Conclusion Pharyngeal cancers, concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and higher thyroid doses significantly increase the risk of hypothyroidism. Optimizing RT planning is essential to minimize thyroid toxicity, particularly in high-risk patients."

4,"Expanding indications of robotic thyroidectomy. Robotic thyroidectomy has many advantages with comparable oncologic safety over conventional open surgery in low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer cases. However, there have been few reports on the outcomes of patients who have been treated with robotic thyroidectomy for more advanced thyroid cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the validity of expanding indications of robotic thyroidectomy for more advanced thyroid cancer. The data of 80 patients with thyroid cancer who underwent robotic total thyroidectomy between January 2013 and December 2014 performed by a single surgeon at Chung-Ang University Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Among them, 40 patients who had cancer larger than 2 cm or suspicious capsular invasion, or central lymph node (LN) metastasis in preoperative pathologic and radiologic examinations were categorized into the more advanced thyroid cancer group and the remaining patients into the early thyroid cancer group. We compared surgical safety and surgical completeness parameters between the two groups. The patients in more advanced thyroid cancer group had larger tumors, more extrathyroidal extension, and higher T stages. Surgical safety parameters, such as hypoparathyroidism, vocal cord palsy, and other complications did not differ significantly between the two groups. Surgical completeness parameters, such as the mean number of retrieved LNs, median values of the stimulated thyroglobulin levels, and the proportion of patients with stimulated thyroglobulin levels less than 1 ng/mL, also did not differ significantly. The outcomes of the patients with more advanced thyroid cancer who were treated with robotic thyroidectomy were comparable to those of the early cancer group patients. Well-designed investigations that are conducted at multiple centers are needed to affirm the validity of expanding indications of robotic thyroidectomy."

4,"Thyroid Cancer Knowledge and Awareness in Saudi Arabia: A Cross-Sectional Study. Background Thyroid cancer incidence has been increasing worldwide over the last few decades. It is the most common endocrine cancer and is most common among females. The study contributes to filling the knowledge gap among Saudi people regarding thyroid cancer. Objectives This research aims to investigate the level of thyroid cancer knowledge and awareness in Saudi Arabia, identify potential knowledge gaps, and develop targeted strategies for enhancing public awareness and education. Methods A cross-sectional, voluntary online survey was conducted from 1st August 2023 to 1st October 2023 among residents living in Saudi Arabia over 18 years of age. The participants included were 2030 respondents. Data analysis was performed using RStudio (R version 4.3.0; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Results Among the participants, the majority were female (60.4%). A total of 49.7% of the individuals reported having a moderate to high level of knowledge about thyroid cancer. While 63.9% knew the association of a lump in the neck to thyroid cancer, 82.6% affirmed to consult a doctor upon discovering a lump, 72.1% knew that regular monitoring of neck lumps is crucial for early diagnosis and treatment of precancerous conditions, 38.7% were aware of females being prone to thyroid cancer, and 59.2% were aware of the link between lifestyle and increased risk. Higher awareness scores were positively associated with female gender, previously having thyroid function tests done, and previously undergoing a US scan of the thyroid. Conclusion In this study, Saudi individuals are reported to lack some aspects of knowledge and perception of thyroid cancer. This study emphasizes filling the existing knowledge gap in thyroid cancer awareness in the Saudi population."
4,"Preoperative serum thyroid stimulating hormone levels in well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma is a predictive factor for lateral lymph node metastasis as well as extrathyroidal extension in Korean patients: a single-center experience. It has been known that thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) stimulates the growth or development of thyroid malignancy and higher serum TSH has association with both thyroid cancer incidence and advanced tumor stage. However, the role of TSH in high-risk features of well-differentiated thyroid cancer was not fully evaluated especially in Asian population. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the association of preoperative serum TSH levels with the advance of differentiated thyroid cancer and its high-risk clinicopathological features in Korean patients. We evaluated 554 patients retrospectively who underwent thyroidectomy and diagnosed as differentiated thyroid cancer during a 3-year period at Pusan National University Hospital. The preoperative TSH levels were significantly higher in the patients with extrathyroidal extension (P = 0.002) and those with lateral lymph node metastasis (P = 0.007). As the increase of the serum TSH concentration, there were significant rising trends in the prevalence of extrathyroidal extension (P = 0.009). In the patients with TSH ≥ 2.5 mIU/L, the prevalences of extrathyroidal extension (P = 0.006) and lateral lymph node metastasis (P = 0.024) were also significantly higher. Using multiple logistic regression, preoperative TSH level was a predictive factor for the presence of extrathyroidal extension (P = 0.008) and lateral lymph node metastasis (P = 0.025). Hashimoto’s thyroiditis itself was not associated with the status of extrathyroidal extension and lateral lymph node metastasis. In conclusion, preoperative TSH levels were associated with lateral lymph node matastasis, a novel finding, and extrathyroidal extension in well differentiated thyroid cancer and might be useful as a preoperative supplementary marker for determining the optimal extent of differentiated thyroid cancer surgery in Korean patients."
4,"Metastatic rectal cancer to papillary thyroid carcinoma: a case report and review of literature Tumor-to-tumor metastasis is a rare event. Rectal cancer to primary thyroid neoplasm metastasis is extremely rare. Herein, we reported a case of metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma to a papillary thyroid carcinoma. The incidence and clinicopathological characteristics of metastatic colorectal cancer to a thyroid gland neoplasm were described, and the pertinent literature was reviewed. A 34-year-old female patient had curative treatment of initial rectal adenocarcinoma in 2012, and was found to have lung metastases by follow-up CT scan 3 years later. In 2018, she was found to have thyroid metastasis by imaging due to left neck pain and hoarseness. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) result suggested suspicious papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The patient underwent a total thyroidectomy and bilateral cervical lymph nodes dissection. The histopathology of thyroidectomy specimen revealed a rectal adenocarcinoma metastatic to the thyroid concomitant with the papillary carcinoma in metastatic adenocarcinoma. The patient received levothyroxine supplementation therapy and palliative chemotherapy with irinotecan and anti-angiogenesis for the metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma. After 1 year of thyroidectomy, no newly developed lesion evidence of recurrent PTC was observed. The patient remains still alive. The possibility of metastases should be considered in patients with a history of rectal cancer and with a thyroid lesion, particularly in those with ageing, hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) or long-term survival. The diagnosis should be histologically confirmed for the presence of both primary thyroid lesions and secondary thyroid neoplasms. Thyroidectomy may be a feasible treatment for symptomatic thyroid metastasis or thyroid cancer. we need to gain more available evidence from large or multi-center clinical data to help clinicians to diagnose rectal cancer to thyroid neoplasm metastases and evaluate treatment."

Such cases may offer unique insights into the interplay between genetic and environmental factors in thyroid cancer development.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CASE PRESENTATION"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We report the case of 67-year-old monozygotic twin sisters, both diagnosed with thyroid malignancies with discordant histology. Patient A presented with a 5.5 cm PDTC with local invasion and distant metastases. She underwent total thyroidectomy and lymphadenectomy followed by radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy. Patient B had a history of recurrent papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) over several years, managed with multiple surgeries and RAI. Despite their identical genetic background, the twins developed distinct thyroid cancer subtypes, with varying ages of onset and clinical courses.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">This case highlights the heterogeneous presentation of thyroid malignancies in genetically identical individuals, suggesting a potential role for environmental or epigenetic factors in tumorigenesis. A review of the literature on thyroid cancer in monozygotic twins indicates a general pattern of similar pathology and age at diagnosis, contrasting with the discordant phenotypes seen in our patients. PDTC poses diagnostic and therapeutic challenges due to its aggressive nature and limited response to conventional therapies. Advances in molecular profiling and targeted treatments may help improve management and outcomes.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">The occurrence of discordant thyroid cancer subtypes in monozygotic twins is exceedingly rare and emphasizes the need for further studies exploring genetic and epigenetic contributions to thyroid cancer. Understanding these factors is critical for developing personalized approaches to diagnosis, treatment, and prevention.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2025.

Exosomes are important mediators of intercellular communication; however, their regulatory mechanisms in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) angiogenesis in breast cancer remain unknown.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We isolated and characterized breast cancer cell-derived exosomes and investigated their functions. Exosomal sequencing and the TCGA database were used to screen long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). In vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to investigate the role of exosomal lncRNA in HUVEC angiogenesis and tumor growth. Molecular methods were used to demonstrate the molecular mechanism of lncRNA.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">We demonstrated that breast cancer cell-derived exosomes promoted HUVEC proliferation, tube formation, and migration. Combining exosomal sequencing results with The Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Cancer database, we screened lncRNA small nucleolar RNA host gene 12 (SNHG12), which was highly expressed in breast cancer cells. SNHG12 was also upregulated in HUVECs co-cultured with exosome-overexpressed SNHG12. Moreover, overexpression of SNHG12 in exosomes increased HUVEC proliferation and migration, whereas deletion of SNHG12 in exosomes showed the opposite effects. In vivo experiments showed that SNHG12 knockdown in exosomes inhibited breast cancer tumor growth. Transcriptome sequencing identified MMP10 as the target gene of SNHG12. Functional experiments revealed that MMP10 overexpression promoted HUVEC angiogenesis. Mechanistically, SNHG12 blocked the interaction between PBRM1 and MMP10 by directly binding to PBRM1. Moreover, exosomal SNHG12 promoted HUVEC angiogenesis via PBRM1 and MMP10.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">In summary, our findings confirmed that exosomal SNHG12 promoted HUVEC angiogenesis via the PBRM1-MMP10 axis, leading to enhanced malignancy of breast cancer. Exosomal SNHG12 may be a novel therapeutic target for breast cancer.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2024. The Author(s).</CopyrightInformation>"
4,"Clinical significance of diffuse [18F] AlF-NOTA-FAPI-04 uptake in the thyroid on PET/CT imaging. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Many patients undergoing [<sup>18</sup>F] AlF-NOTA-FAPI-04 (<sup>18</sup>F-FAPI) PET/CT demonstrated diffuse thyroid uptake. These findings created challenges for accurate interpretation due to the limited understanding of physiological and non-oncologic causes of diffuse <sup>18</sup>F-FAPI uptake in the thyroid. This retrospective study examined patients who underwent <sup>18</sup>F-FAPI PET/CT imaging with diffuse thyroid uptake. It quantitatively assessed normal thyroid uptake, compared <sup>18</sup>F-FAPI uptake between normal and diseased thyroids, and explored potential associations with diffuse thyroid uptake. The study may improve the accuracy of <sup>18</sup>F-FAPI PET/CT interpretation for thyroid and facilitate appropriate management of diffuse thyroid uptake on <sup>18</sup>F-FAPI PET/CT.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">A total of 38 patients were included in this study based on the inclusion criteria.

4,"LncRNA XIST/miR-34a axis modulates the cell proliferation and tumor growth of thyroid cancer through MET-PI3K-AKT signaling Thyroid cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies in endocrine system. Further understanding and revealing the molecular mechanism underlying thyroid cancer are indispensable for the development of effective diagnosis and treatments. In the present study, we attempted to provide novel basis for targeted therapy for thyroid cancer from the aspect of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction. The expression and cellular function of XIST (X-inactive specific transcript) was determined. miRNAs which may be direct targets of XIST were screened for from online GEO database and miR-34a was selected. Next, the predicted binding between XIST and miR-34a, and the dynamic effect of XIST and miR-34a on downstream MET (hepatocyte growth factor receptor)-PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase)-AKT (α-serine/threonine-protein kinase) signaling was evaluated. XIST was significantly up-regulated in thyroid cancer tissues and cell lines; XIST knockdown suppressed the cell proliferation in vivo and the tumor growth in vitro. Based on online database and online tool prediction results, miR-34a was underexpressed in thyroid cancer and might be a direct target of XIST. Herein, we confirmed the negative interaction between XIST and miR-34a; moreover, XIST knockdown could reduce the protein levels of MET, a downstream target of miR-34a, and the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT. In thyroid cancer tissues, MET mRNA and protein levels of MET were up-regulated; MET was positively correlated with XIST while negatively correlated with miR-34a, further confirming that XIST serves as a ceRNA for miR-34a through sponging miR-34a, competing with MET for miR-34a binding, and finally modulating thyroid cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth. In the present study, we provided novel experimental basis for targeted therapy for thyroid cancer from the aspect of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA interaction."
4,"Ultrasonography survey and thyroid cancer in the Fukushima Prefecture Thyroid cancer is one of the major health concerns after the accident in the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power station (NPS). Currently, ultrasonography surveys are being performed for persons residing in the Fukushima Prefecture at the time of the accident with an age of up to 18 years. Here, the expected thyroid cancer prevalence in the Fukushima Prefecture is assessed based on an ultrasonography survey of Ukrainians, who were exposed at an age of up to 18 years to 131 I released during the Chernobyl NPS accident, and on differences in equip- ment and study protocol in the two surveys. Radiation risk of thyroid cancer incidence among survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and preliminary estimates of thyroid dose due to the Fukushima accident were used for the prediction of baseline and radiation- related thyroid cancer risks. We estimate a prevalence of thyroid cancer of 0.027 % (95 % CI 0.010 %; 0.050 %) for the first screening campaign in the Fukushima Prefecture. Compared with the incidence rate in Japan in 2007, the ultrasonography survey is predicted to increase baseline thyroid cancer incidence by a factor of 7.4 (95 % CI 0.95; 17.3). Under the condition of continued screening, thyroid cancer during the first fifty years after the accident is pre- dicted to be detected for about 2 % of the screened popu- lation. The prediction of radiation-related thyroid cancer in the most exposed fraction (a few ten thousand persons) of the screened population of the Fukushima Prefecture has a large uncertainty with the best estimates of the average risk of 0.1-0.3 %, depending on average dose."
4,"Adrenal metastasis as the initial diagnosis of synchronous papillary and follicular thyroid cancer Differentiated thyroid cancer uncommonly presents with distant metastases. Adrenal metastasis from differentiated thyroid cancer presenting as the initial finding is even less common. A 71-year-old male was incidentally found on chest CT to have bilateral thyroid nodules, which were confirmed on ultrasound. Fine needle aspiration of the dominant right 3.3 cm nodule contained histologic features most consistent with Bethesda classification III, and repeat fine needle aspiration revealed pathology consistent with Bethesda classification II. Follow-up thyroid ultrasound showed 1% increase and 14% increase in nodule volume at one and two years, respectively, compared to baseline. Prior to the second annual thyroid ultrasound, the patient was incidentally found to have a 4.1 cm heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right adrenal gland on CT of the abdomen and pelvis. Biochemical evaluation was unremarkable with the exception of morning cortisol of 3.2 µg/dL after dexamethasone suppression. The patient then underwent laparoscopic right adrenal gland excision, which revealed metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma. Total thyroidectomy was then performed, with pathology showing a 4.8 cm well-differentiated follicular thyroid carcinoma of the right lobe, a 0.5 cm noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features of the left lobe, and a 0.1 cm papillary microcarcinoma of the left lobe. Thyrotropin-stimulated whole body scan showed normal physiologic uptake of the remnant thyroid tissue without evidence of other iodine avid disease. The patient then received radioactive iodine. At follow-up 14 months after total thyroidectomy, he remains free of recurrent disease. Despite following the recommended protocol for evaluation and surveillance of thyroid nodules, thyroid cancer can be challenging to diagnose, and may not be diagnosed until distant metastases are identified."
4,"Long glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper regulates human thyroid cancer cell proliferation Long glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (L-GILZ) has recently been implicated in cancer cell proliferation. Here, we investigated its role in human thyroid cancer cells. L-GILZ protein was highly expressed in well-differentiated cancer cells from thyroid cancer patients and differentiated thyroid cancer cell lines, but poorly expressed in anaplastic tumors. A fusion protein containing L-GILZ, when overexpressed in an L-GILZ-deficient 8505C cell line derived from undifferentiated human thyroid cancer tissue, inhibited cellular proliferation in vitro. In addition, when this protein was injected into nude mice, in which cells from line 8505C had been transplanted, xenograft growth was reduced. Since the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is frequently hyperactivated in thyroid cancer cells as a result of the BRAFV600E or Ras mutation, we sought to further investigate the role of L-GILZ in the MAPK pathway. To this end, we analyzed L-GILZ expression and function in cells treated with MAPK inhibitors. We used 8505C cells, which have the BRAFV600E mutation, or the CAL-62 cell line, which harbors a Ras mutation. The cells were treated with the BRAF-specific drug vemurafenib (PLX4032) or the MEK1/2 inhibitor, U0126, respectively. Treatment with these agents inhibited MAPK activation, reduced cell proliferation, and upregulated L-GILZ expression. L-GILZ silencing reversed the antiproliferative activity of the MAPK inhibitors, consistent with an antiproliferative role. Treatment with MAPK inhibitors led to the phosphorylation of the cAMP/response element-binding protein (CREB), and active CREB bound to the L-GILZ promoter, contributing to its transcription. We suggest that the CREB signaling pathway, frequently deregulated in thyroid tumors, is involved in L-GILZ upregulation and that L-GILZ regulates thyroid cancer cell proliferation, which may have potential in cancer treatment."
4,"Epidemiology of Thyroid Cancer: A Review of the National Cancer Database, 2000-2013. Objective ; ; To show the recent trends in thyroid cancer in the United States, elucidate the characteristics of stage IV thyroid cancer, and consider the effects of diagnostic testing on the rising incidence of thyroid cancer.; ; Design; ;  A retrospective population-based study conducted using the National Cancer Database from 2000-2013 (NCDB). Demographics of patients presenting with stage IV thyroid cancer were compared to patients presenting with all other stages using the chi-square testing. The incidence rates were examined with the trend graphs.; ; Results; ;  When compared to stages I-III, there was an increased incidence of stage IV thyroid cancer in: Medicare, lower level of education, lower income, advanced age, male sex, increased number of comorbidities, further distance from a treatment facility, and medullary/anaplastic histology. The incidence of thyroid cancer increased from 7.1 per 100,000 in 2000 to 17.6 per 100,000 in 2013. During this same time period, stage IV disease increased 1 per 100,000. The increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer was almost entirely due to an increase in papillary cancer.; ; Conclusions; ;  The United States has continued to see a rise in the incidence of thyroid cancer over the last decade, largely due to the detection of papillary cancers. During this same time, the incidence of stage IV thyroid cancer increased as well. Because early diagnosis and treatment of an increasing number of potentially lethal cancers should lead to a decrease in metastatic disease, we suggest that the increasing incidence of thyroid cancer in the United States is due to overdiagnosis and that more aggressive disease is not being removed by early detection."
4,"Thyroid Cancer Staging: Historical Evolution and Analysis From Macrocarcinoma to Microcarcinoma. The classification of thyroid cancer diagnosis and treatment has evolved dramatically since the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) published the first staging system in 1968. A careful review of the eight published editions of well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC) staging by the UICC and the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) was performed. Each edition was analyzed to clearly understand which development published and accepted by specialists treating thyroid cancer justified considering a new updated edition. This study presents a comprehensive review of the remarkable evolution of thyroid cancer staging, highlighting the various changes in several areas throughout the years and editions. There were surprising changes within the eight publications: the tumor size was progressively reduced from 4 cm in the first AJCC volume to less than 1 cm in the seventh and eighth UICC and AJCC editions, classifying these small, WDTCs known up to now as ""microcarcinomas."" Extrathyroidal extension was accepted after the third edition; this description certainly plays a key role in today's decisions to manage this tumor as a prognostic factor. The age specification of 45 years prevailed for seven consecutive publications until it was raised to 55 years in the eighth thyroid cancer staging system. Without a doubt, this iconic change allowed physicians around the world to give their 45-year-old thyroid cancer patients a more encouraging panorama of the disease with the new classification. Over the course of nearly 57 years, thyroid cancer staging has undergone remarkable changes, reaching a level of certainty that not only provides recommendations for safer treatments with less surgery and adjunctive measures but also improves survival rates and patient safety."
4,"Clinicopathological features of thyroid cancer in the elderly compared to younger counterparts: single-center experience. The incidence of thyroid cancer is increased in elderly patients. It tends to be larger and have more aggressive characteristics in these patients. Our aim was to compare features of thyroid carcinoma in geriatric and non-geriatric patients. In total, 933 patients with thyroid cancer were retrospectively reviewed. Thyroid functions, ultrasonography features of malignant nodules, cytological and histopathological findings and the rates of recurrence and persistence were compared in patients ≥65 and <65 years old. There were 153 malignant foci in 109 (11.7%) patients ≥65 and 1185 malignant foci in 824 (88.3%) patients <65 years old. Mean nodule diameter was significantly higher in geriatric patients (p = 0.008). Most of the ultrasonographical features of malignant nodules were similar in two groups. Hypoechoic halo was observed in 16.4 and 28.6% of malignant nodules in geriatric and non-geriatric group, respectively (p = 0.034). There was no significant difference in cytological diagnosis. Histopathologically, tumor diameter, rates of microcarcinomas and incidentality were similar. Of all cancer types, 88.8% in geriatric and 93.9% in non-geriatric group were papillary thyroid cancer (p = 0.028). Hurthle cell cancer constituted 3.9 and 1.1% of carcinomas in geriatric and non-geriatric patients, respectively (p = 0.015); 2.0 and 0.2% of tumors in geriatric and non-geriatric group were anaplastic, respectively (p = 0.012). Capsular and vascular invasion, extrathyroidal extension, persistence and recurrence rates were similar.;  Rates of anaplastic cancer and Hurthle cell cancer which is known to have worser prognosis among other differentiated thyroid cancers are increased in geriatric ages. Cytological evaluation of thyroid nodules should strongly be considered due to increased tendency for aggressive tumor types in these patients."
4,"Lung adenocarcinoma with thyroid metastasis: a case report The metastases of a primary lung cancer over the thyroid gland are extremely rare. We report on an unusual presentation of thyroid metastasis of lung cancer in order to improve the management of similar cases. Three years ago, a Moroccan male 59-year-old was admitted for dyspnea, dry cough, and chest pain. He had smoked about 30 cigarette packs a year. Clinical examination revealed a right thyroid nodule. Chest and neck computed tomography (CT) scan showed a proximal left tumor in contact with the pulmonary artery and revealed a suspected nodule in the right lobe of the thyroid with homolateral neck node. Transbronchial biopsy was performed and pathological examination revealed adenocarcinoma of the lung and positive for thyroid transcription factor. Other explorations carried out, such as brain CT, bone scan and abdominal ultrasound were normal. After a repeated negative fine needle aspiration biopsy of the suspected nodule of the right lobe of the thyroid, we performed total thyroidectomy with neck dissection. An anatomopathologic exam revealed a tubulopapillary adenocarcinoma poorly differentiated. An Immunohistochemistry showed positive tumor cells with TTF1 and cytokeratin (CK) 7 but negative cells with thyroglobulin and CK20. Thus, the pulmonary tumor was classified stage IV. Chemotherapy based on the combination of cisplatin and etoposide was conducted along with supportive care. The tumor grew up with brain metastases after three cycles of chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the patient died 2 months after despite brain radiotherapy. We presented a medical case of a patient with thyroid metastasis resulting from a pulmonary adenocarcinoma which has rapidly evolved to brain metastases. The prognosis was pejorative in our clinical case (5 months after admission)."
4,"Anthropometric factors at age 20 years and risk of thyroid cancer Effect of anthropometric factors at adolescence and the change since young age on thyroid cancer risk is unclear. Here, we conducted a case-control study to investigate the association between anthropometric factors at the time of diagnosis and age 20 years and risk of thyroid cancer. A total of 173 patients with thyroid cancer (papillary carcinoma, n = 167 and follicular carcinoma, n = 6) and 865 age- and sex-matched controls were included. Anthropometric factors were assessed using a validated self-administered questionnaire and categorized into three groups. Odd ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using conditional logistic models adjusted for potential confounders. Results showed a positive association between current weights, weight at age 20 years and height, and thyroid cancer risk. Adjusted ORs in the top tertiles were 2.46 (95% CI, 1.54-3.94; trend p \ 0.001) for current weight, 2.69 (95% CI, 1.71-4.25; trend p \ 0.001) for weight at age 20 years and 2.44 (95% CI, 1.52-3.93; trend p \ 0.001) for height compared with the lowest tertile. A positive association with current body surface area (BSA), BSA at age 20 years, and current body mass index was also observed, with respective adjusted ORs in the top tertile of 1.96 (95% CI, 1.23-3.11; trend p = 0.007), 1.82 (95% CI, 1.15-2.88; trend p = 0.007) and 1.71 (95% CI, 1.06-2.78; trend p = 0.034). In contrast, no association with risk was seen for a change in anthropometric factors since age 20 years. These findings suggested that body size in early life as well as in adult is associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer."
4,"Vitamin C sensitizes BRAF V600E thyroid cancer to PLX4032 via inhibiting the feedback activation of MAPK/ERK signal by PLX4032 BRAFV600E mutation is the most common mutation in thyroid cancer. It strongly activates MAPK/ERK pathway and indicates an invasive subtype of thyroid cancer. PLX4032 is a selective oral inhibitor of the BRAFV600 kinase although with limited effect in treating this panel of thyroid cancer, due to the feedback activation of MAPK/ERK as well as PI3K/AKT pathways. It was investigated that Vitamin C plays a positive role in inhibiting these pathways in thyroid cancer. However, whether Vitamin C could enhance the antitumor effect of PLX4032 remains largely unclear. The antitumor efficacy of combination therapy with PLX4032 and Vitamin C on BRAFMT thyroid cancer cell was assessed by the MTT assay, EdU assay and colony formation, Chou-Talalay way was employed to analyze the synergistic effect. Flow cytometry were employed to assess cells’ apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in response to combination therapy. Xenograft models were used to test its in vivo antitumor activity. Western blot and IHC were applied to investigate the mechanism underlying synergistic effect. PLX4032 or Vitamin C monotherapy was mildly effective in treating BRAFMT thyroid cancer cell and xenografts model. The combination therapy significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation and tumor growth in nude mice, and induced cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest compared to either monotherapy. PLX4032 monotherapy induced feedback activation of MAPK/ERK as well as PI3K/AKT pathway; while combination therapy significantly relieved this feedback. Vitamin C promotes the antitumor effect of PLX4032 in BRAFMT thyroid cancer cell and xenografts model via relieving the feedback activation of MAPK/ERK as well as PI3K/AKT pathway. PLX4032/Vitamin C combination may be a potential therapeutic approach to treat BRAFMT thyroid cancer."
4,"Update to the College of American Pathologists Reporting on Thyroid Carcinomas Background The reporting of thyroid carcinomas follows the recommendations of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) protocols and includes papillary carcinoma, follicular carcinoma, anaplastic carcinoma and medullary carcinoma. Despite past and recent efforts, there are a number of controversial issues in the classification and diagnosis of thyroid carcinomas (TC) that, potentially impact on therapy and prognosis of patients with TC. Discussion The most updated version of the CAP thyroid cancer protocol incorporates recent changes in histologic classification as well as changes in the staging of thyroid cancers as per the updated American Joint Commission on Cancer staging manual. Among the more contentious issues in the pathology of thyroid carcinoma include the defining criteria for tumor invasiveness. While there are defined criteria for invasion, there is not universal agreement in what constitutes capsular invasion, angioinvasion and extrathyroidal invasion. Irrespective of the discrepant views on invasion, pathologists should report on the presence and extent (focal, widely) of capsular invasion, angioinvasion and extrathyroidal extension. These findings assist clinicians in their assessment of the recurrence risk and potential for metastatic disease. It is beyond the scope of this paper to detail the entire CAP protocol for thyroid carcinomas; rather, this paper addresses some of the more problematic issues confronting pathologists in their assessment and reporting of thyroid carcinomas. Conclusion The new CAP protocol for reporting of thyroid carcinomas is a step toward improving the clinical value of the histopathologic reporting of TC. Large meticulous clinico-pathologic and molecular studies with long term follow up are still needed in order to increase the impact of microscopic examination on the prognosis and management of TC."

4,"Comparison of Secondary and Primary Thyroid Cancers: Patient Characteristics and Postoperative Outcomes: A Cross-Sectional Analysis of Patients with Primary and Secondary Thyroid Cancers. Secondary thyroid cancer is believed to lead to a more aggressive clinical course than primary thyroid cancer. We aim to examine the difference between primary and secondary thyroid cancer in terms of patient characteristics and perioperative outcomes at the national level. A cross-sectional study utilizing the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database for 2003–2010 was merged with County Health Rankings Data. International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes were used to identify adult patients with thyroid cancer. A total of 21,581 discharge records were included. Overall, 16,625 (77.0 %) patients had primary cancer, while the rest (23.0 %) had secondary cancer. Younger ( 65 years) patients, males, and those of White or Hispanic background were more likely to have secondary cancers (p < 0.05 each). The prevalence of secondary cancer was higher in communities of low health risk (24.0 % vs. 21.1 %; p < 0.024). Secondary cancer was more likely to be managed by total thyroidectomy (odds ratio [OR] 2.40, 95 % CI 2.12–2.73) and to require additional radical neck dissection (OR 12.51, 95 % CI 10.98–14.25). Patients with secondary thyroid cancers were at higher risk of postoperative complications (p < 0.01 each). The cost of secondary cancer management was significantly higher than primary cancer (US$12,449.00 ± 302.07 vs. US$7848.12 ± 149.05; p < 0.001). However, compared with intermediate-volume surgeons, the complication risk was lower for high-volume (OR 0.47, 95 % CI 0.24–0.92; p = 0.026). Secondary thyroid cancer is associated with a higher risk of perioperative complications and higher cost and distinct demographic profile. Patients managed by higher-volume surgeons were less likely to experience disadvantageous outcomes."
4,"Predictive factors that influence the course of medullary thyroid carcinoma Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is an infrequent form of thyroid cancer. We aimed to examine how gender and histological characteristics influence the rate of recurrence/persistent disease, distant metastases and survival and also to define specific characteristics of MTC microcarcinomas. The medical records of 85 patients with MTC were reviewed. The following characteristics were recorded: year of diagnosis, age at diagnosis, sex, tumor size, number of tumor foci, lymph node metastases, thyroid capsule and vascular invasion, infiltration of thyroid parenchyma and extrathyroid extension, and distant metastases. During follow-up (mean 78.8 months), persistent disease occurred in 40 patients, local recurrences in 5 and distant metastases in 32 patients. Local and distant disease appeared more frequently in patients with larger tumors (p < 0.005) and lymph node metastases (p < 0.01). In addition, patients with invasive tumors had local and distant disease more frequently. The percentage of males who had persistent disease and/or local recurrence was significantly higher than the percentage of males who did not (p < 0.05). Similar results were observed for distant disease (p < 0.01). Independent predictors of recurrence and persistent disease was the presence of lymph node metastases at diagnosis (risk ratio 11.66) and of distant metastases were the presence of lymph node metastases at diagnosis (risk ratio 17.42) and the presence of vascular invasion (risk ratio 2.41). Fifteen patients died due to MTC during follow-up (17.6 %). Patients who died were more frequently males, and had thyroid capsule invasion, extrathyroidal extension, vascular invasion and metastatic disease. Male sex, tumor size and invasive characteristics of the tumor are negative predictive factors for evolution of MTC."
4,"Hsa_circ_0011385 accelerates the progression of thyroid cancer by targeting miR-361-3p. Thyroid cancer is an endocrine malignancy that is growing in incidence worldwide. Despite progress in diagnostics and treatment of thyroid cancer, prognosis remains poor. Emerging research has shown that circular RNAs (circRNAs) have crucial regulatory roles in cancers. However, the possible functions and mechanisms of hsa_circ_0011385 remain undetermined. Expression levels of hsa_circ_0011385 and miR-361-3p were evaluated by qRT-PCR assay. The interaction between hsa_circ_0011385 and miR-361-3p was verified by dual-luciferase reporter assay. Effects of hsa_circ_0011385 or miR-361-3p on cell viability, proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, migration and invasion were confirmed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), carboxyfluoresceinsuccinimidyl ester (CFSE), flow cytometry, and Transwell assays in vitro. The effect of hsa_circ_0011385 on thyroid cancer progression was also determined by in vivo tumor formation assay. Target genes of miR-361-3p were predicted by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, and the expression of apoptosis- and metastasis-related proteins were assessed by Western blot assay. Hsa_circ_0011385 upregulated in thyroid cancer; hsa_circ_0011385 knockdown inhibited thyroid cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and promoted cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In addition, hsa_circ_0011385 could negatively regulate miR-361-3p by functioning as a sponge. Hsa_circ_0011385 promoted thyroid cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion and suppressed cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by targeting miR-361-3p in vitro. We also found that hsa_circ_0011385 knockdown dramatically inhibited thyroid cancer growth in vivo. Furthermore, hsa_circ_0011385 regulated expression of apoptosis and metastasis-related proteins in thyroid cancer. Hsa_circ_0011385facilitated thyroid cancer cell proliferation, invasion and migration, and inhibited thyroid cancer cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by targeting miR-361-3p, suggesting that the hsa_circ_0011385/miR-361-3p axis might be a promising therapeutic target for thyroid cancer."
4,"Src-mediated regulation of the PI3K pathway in advanced papillary and anaplastic thyroid cancer Advanced stages of papillary and anaplastic thyroid cancer continue to be plagued by a dismal prognosis, which is a result of limited effective therapies for these cancers. Due to the high proportion of thyroid cancers harboring mutations in the MAPK pathway, the MAPK pathway has become a focal point for therapeutic intervention in thyroid cancer. Unfortunately, unlike melanoma, a similar responsiveness to MAPK pathway inhibition has yet to be observed in thyroid cancer patients. To address this issue, we have focused on targeting the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, Src, and we and others have demonstrated that targeting Src results in inhibition of growth, invasion, and migration both in vitro and in vivo, which can be enhanced through the combined inhibition of Src and the MAPK pathway. Therefore, we examined the efficacy of the combination therapy across a panel of thyroid cancer cell lines representing common oncogenic drivers (BRAF, RAS, and PIK3CA). Interestingly, combined inhibition of Src and the MAPK pathway overcomes intrinsic dasatinib resistance in cell lines where both the MAPK and PI3K pathways are inhibited, which we show is likely due to the regulation of the PI3K pathway by Src in these responsive cells. Interestingly, we have mapped downstream phosphorylation of rpS6 as a key biomarker of response, and cells that maintain rpS6 phosphorylation likely represent drug tolerant persisters. Altogether, the combined inhibition of Src and the MAPK pathway holds great promise for improving the overall survival of advanced thyroid cancer patients with BRAF and RAS mutations, and activation of the PI3K pathway and rpS6 phosphorylation represent important biomarkers of response for patients treated with this therapy."
4,"Ensemble model for neoadjuvant chemotherapy response prediction and treatment sensitivity in TNBC based on DNA replication stress signatures. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly aggressive subtype of breast cancer. Although neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) has some effectiveness in TNBC, a portion of patients still do not benefit from them. The critical role of DNA replication stress (DRS) in cancer therapy has been recognized, but its study in TNBC NACT remains relatively limited. Affymetrix microarray data were obtained from the GEO database for both training and test sets. These data were processed using the ""affy"" R package. The Boruta algorithm and SVM-RFE method were employed for key gene selection, and an integrated model based on multiple algorithms was developed to establish a risk score. Additionally, the tumor microenvironment (TME) was analyzed, and the correlation between risk score and drug sensitivity was explored, incorporating several drug databases. Through the analysis of TNBC patients' responses to NACT, we found a close correlation between DRS and TNBC treatment responses and identified eight key genes. The developed ensemble model (ENS) demonstrated high AUC values of 0.922, 0.886, and 0.858 across the three independent datasets, respectively, indicating its strong ability to accurately predict the effectiveness of NACT. The study also revealed that patients with higher risk score are more prone to recurrence and metastasis, and have a rich TME composition. Additionally, drug sensitivity analysis offers potentially effective personalized treatment options for high-risk TNBC. This study successfully constructed an ensemble model to predict TNBC patients' response to NACT. Additionally, it was discovered that the risk score held significant value in analyzing the correlation between TNBC patients' TME and drug sensitivity. These findings offer important new insights into personalized treatment strategies for TNBC."

Notably, BRAF V600E mutations were associated with higher GEP3 expression levels, indicating that ELF3 may be a pivotal marker for aggressive disease progression, especially in BRAF-mutant PTC. Functional assays confirmed that ELF3 knockdown suppressed EMT and angiogenesis, reducing PTC cell migration and invasion. Regardless of whether they are positive or negative for BRAF V600E mutations, showed increased sensitivity to vemurafenib in higher ELF3 expression group.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">This study highlights the critical role of GEP and ELF3 in driving PTC progression and metastasis.

4,"Longchain serum fatty acids and risk of thyroid cancer: a population-based case-control study in Norway. Epidemiologic studies have shown an association between seafood consumption and risk of thyroid cancer. Fish meals increase the serum concentrations of the longchain fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (20∶5,n-3) (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (22∶6,n-3) (DHA), for days. The hypothesis that serum concentrations of fatty acids may be associated with thyroid cancer risk therefore was tested in a population-based case-control study with 74 cases and 221 matched controls. Seventy-three cases with sera in the Norwegian serum bank (JANUS) were identified in the Norwegian Cancer Registry and matched with three controls, also in JANUS, on age, gender, place of residence, and time of blood sampling. Each case was matched with two controls. Serum concentrations of 11 longchain fatty acids were determined blindly by gas chromatography for all subjects. Controls were divided into three groups with increasing serum fatty acid concentrations, and odds ratios between cases and controls were estimated relative to the group with lowest serum level by univariate and multivariate analyses. The main finding was a significant inverse relation between the sum of arachidonic acid (20∶4,n-6) (AA) and DHA serum concentrations and thyroid cancer risk. The significance of this association was weakened when the analyses were restricted to the papillary type of thyroid carcinoma. It was of the same order of magnitude whether the period between blood sampling and diagnosis was greater than eight years, or eight or less years. High EPA/AA ratio, indicating consumption of fish fat, was not associated significantly with increased thyroid-cancer risk. These data indicate that the association between seafood ingestion and increased thyroid-cancer risk may not be caused by the marine fatty acids."
4,"Molecular detection of thyroglobulin mRNA transcripts in peripheral blood of patients with thyroid disease by RT-PCR The sensitive detection of circulating tumour cells in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer may precede the detection of relapse by other diagnostic studies – such as serum thyroglobulin – and thus may have important therapeutic and prognostic implications. We performed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) on blood samples from patients diagnosed with thyroid disease using two different RT-PCR sensitivities. Additionally, tissue specificity of TG mRNA-expression was determined using RNA extracts from 27 different human tissues. The lower limit of detection was 50–100 TG mRNA producing cells/ml blood using a ‘normal’ RT-PCR sensitivity and 10–20 cells/ml blood using a ‘high’ sensitivity. With the normal sensitivity TG mRNA was detected in 9/13 patients with thyroid cancer and metastasis, 63/137 patients with a history of thyroid cancer and no metastasis, 21/85 with non-malignant thyroid disease and 9/50 controls. With the high sensitivity TG mRNA was detected in 11/13 patients with thyroid cancer and metastasis, 111/137 patients with a history of thyroid cancer and no metastasis, 61/85 with non-malignant thyroid disease and 41/50 controls. Interestingly, using the normal RT-PCR sensitivity TG mRNA transcripts are specific for thyroid tissue and detectable in the peripheral blood of controls and patients with thyroid disease, which correlates with a diagnosis of metastasized thyroid cancer. However, with a high RT-PCR sensitivity, TG mRNA expression was found not to be specific for thyroid tissue and was not correlated with a diagnosis of thyroid cancer in patients. As a consequence, to date TG mRNA detected by RT-PCR in the peripheral blood cannot be recommended as a tumour marker superior to TG serum-level. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaign"

Aggressive morphology was observed in KRAS-WT and KRAS-G12V overexpressed WRO cells. These results suggested that overexpression of KRAS-WT or KRAS-G12V may induce dedifferentiation in DTC cells. The expression of Nrf2 was increased by KRAS-WT and KRAS-G12V in DTC cells. In addition, compared with normal thyroid tissues, the expression of Nrf2 protein was considerably higher in thyroid cancer tissues on immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, and the increased expression of Nrf2 indicated a poor prognosis of thyroid cancer. These results indicated that Nrf2 is the KRAS downstream molecule in thyroid cancer. Functional studies showed that the Nrf2 inhibitor Brusatol counteracted the proliferative and invasive abilities induced by KRAS-WT and KRAS-G12V in BCPAP and WRO cells. In addition, the xenograft assay further confirmed that Brusatol inhibits tumor growth induced by KRAS-WT and KRAS-G12V.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Collectively, this study suggests that Nrf2 could be a promising therapeutic target in KRAS-mediated dedifferentiation of thyroid cancer.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2023.
