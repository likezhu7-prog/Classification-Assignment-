0,"Surgery of colon cancer in a district hospital Colorectal cancer is a common illness and continues even today to be the second cause of death in the U.S.A., after lung cancer. Although the incidence of gastric and pancreatic cancer has declined dramatically in recent years, the incidence of colorectal cancer has increased. The aim of our study is to present our experience and results of surgical techniques applied in our clinic for the treatment of colorectal cancer and its complications. We present our experience in treating colorectal cancer for the five-year period of 2006–2010 during which 49 patients were treated with colorectal cancer in our clinic, of whom 28 were men, with a mean age of 62 years and 21 were women, with a mean age of 66 years. In 15 cases, the cancerous lesion involved the rectum and in 34 the remaining colon. In 2 patients, concomitant cancer was found at a separate site within the bowel. In the first case, the tumour was found both in the caecum and high up in the rectum, while in the second case, cancer was found both within the transverse and the sigmoid colon. Six of our patients suffered from co-existing biliary lithiasis and thus underwent simultaneous cholecystectomy and in one of these patients a simultaneous bile duct exploration for common bile duct lithiasis was performed. In 15 of our patients, the malignant lesion was situated in the rectum and 8 of these patients underwent abdominoperineal resection while 7 had a low anterior resection. In 11 patients, the lesion was found in the sigmoid, 8 of whom had a Hartmann procedure and 3 a sigmoidectomy. In 5 patients who presented with cancer in the descending colon and in one with cancer in the splenic flexure, a left hemicolectomy was performed. In 3 patients, the lesion involved the right colic flexure, in 3 the ascending colon, in 6 the caecum and in 2 the vermiform appendix at its base; these 14 patients underwent a right hemicolectomy. The remaining 3 patients had cancer located in the transverse colon and underwent a resection of the transverse colon. Twenty-eight of the patients with colonic cancer were operated on an emergency basis. There were 2 postoperative deaths due to septic shock and multiple organ failure. In total we noted 7 complications, all of which concerned patients who had undergone emergency surgery. The length of hospital stay was between 8 and 14 days. Four of the patients with stage IV disease died two years after surgery; the remainder are still alive. We conclude that colorectal cancer continues to occur after the sixth decade with male predominance; its main localization is within the rectum and the sigmoid colon. The high complication rate of obstructive ileus in our region indicates inadequate access of the public to diagnostic facilities in our area. Despite this, the mortality level remains low."
0,"Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF) Upregulates CXCR7 and Contributes to Chemotherapy Resistance in Colorectal Cancer. Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors worldwide, with high incidence and mortality rates making it a focus of research. Chemotherapy is a primary treatment modality for colon cancer, but chemotherapy resistance severely impacts treatment efficacy. MIF has been found to promote tumor progression and resistance in various cancers. This study aims to investigate the role of MIF in chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer and its potential mechanisms, particularly through the upregulation of CXCR7 expression, affecting the metabolism and drug sensitivity of colon cancer cells. The expression levels of MIF in colon cancer tissues and its association with patient prognosis were evaluated by analyzing TCGA and HPA data. Subsequently, the expression levels of MIF in colon cancer cell lines and resistant cell lines were detected by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, and the effect of MIF on oxaliplatin sensitivity was assessed. The impact of MIF on the metabolic activity of colon cancer cells was measured using a cellular energy metabolism analyzer. Further experiments explored the mechanism by which MIF affects the metabolic activity of colon cancer cells through the upregulation of CXCR7 expression, and the role of CTCF in regulating CXCR7 transcription was validated by silencing CTCF. Finally, the effect of MIF on drug sensitivity of colon cancer cells was verified in a mouse xenograft tumor model. In this study, we found that the expression of MIF in colon cancer tissues was significantly higher than in normal tissues, and high MIF expression was associated with poor prognosis in patients. The expression levels of MIF in resistant colon cancer cell lines were significantly higher than in parental cell lines, and MIF overexpression significantly increased the resistance of colon cancer cells to oxaliplatin. Conversely, silencing MIF significantly reduced the IC50 value of resistant cells and increased apoptosis. MIF overexpression significantly increased the ECAR and OCR levels of colon cancer cells, while MIF knockdown significantly reduced these metabolic indicators. Further studies indicated that MIF affects the metabolic activity of colon cancer cells by upregulating CXCR7 expression. CTCF binding peaks at the CXCR7 promoter region and luciferase activity assays indicated that CTCF regulates CXCR7 transcription, and silencing CTCF significantly enhanced the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to oxaliplatin. In vivo experiments in mice showed that MIF silencing combined with oxaliplatin treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth and increased the necrotic area of tumor tissues. In conclusion, this study reveals the crucial role of MIF in chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer through the upregulation of CXCR7 expression, with CTCF playing an important regulatory role in this process. Our findings provide new theoretical insights and potential therapeutic targets for overcoming chemotherapy resistance in colon cancer. Future research should further explore the roles of MIF and CXCR7 in other types of cancers and the potential of MIF and CXCR7 as therapeutic targets."
0,"Left-Sided Colon Cancer and Right-Sided Colon Cancer: Are They the Same Cancer or Two Different Entities? Background Colon cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world and one of the main causes of cancer-related deaths. In Morocco, it occupies the first place among digestive cancers. Right-sided and left-sided colon cancers have different embryological, epidemiological, pathological, genetic, and clinical characteristics. This distinction leads to differences in the evolution and prognosis of the disease. This study aimed to identify epidemiological factors and clinical and pathological characteristics that can influence perioperative and prognostic outcomes in patients with right-sided colon cancer compared to those with left-sided colon cancer. Methodology We conducted a retrospective cohort study over a period of nine years from January 2012 until December 2020. We included 277 patients divided into two groups, namely, right colon cancer (group 1) (n = 99) and left colon cancer (group 2) (n = 178). Results The average age of our series was 57.4 years, with extremes ranging from 19 to 89 years old (SD = ±13.6451 years). The average age in the right colon group was 55.97 (SD = ±13.341 years). The average age in the left colon group was 58.18 (SD = ±13.69 years). The male gender had a predominance, with a sex ratio of 1.3 for both groups. Among the patients in group 2, 65% showed lymph node involvement on the CT scan, whereas only 34% of patients in group 1 displayed the same condition. The recurrence rate in the right-sided colon cancer group was 22.2% compared to 24.9% in the left-sided group. The five-year overall survival was estimated for the right-sided and left-sided colon cancer groups at 87% and 96.5%, respectively. In patients with stage III and IV cancer, overall survival was better for those who underwent surgery for left-sided colon cancer compared to those who underwent surgery for right-sided colon cancer (p = 0.029). In the case of vascular emboli or involvement of the perineural sheath, there was no significant difference in overall survival (p = 0.446 and p = 0.655, respectively). The three-month survival without recurrence was almost identical in both groups (31% for right-sided colon cancers and 30.9% for left-sided colon cancers). Age over 61 years was a predictive factor of poor prognosis in recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio = 3.245; p = 0.023). Conclusions We identified factors that can influence perioperative outcomes and prognosis in patients with right-sided colon cancer compared to those with left-sided colon cancer. Our findings suggest that age and lymph node involvement along with other factors play a role in the overall survival and recurrence outcomes of these patients. Further research is necessary to explore these differences and develop personalized treatment plans for patients with colon cancer."
0,"Effect of Chemotherapy Treatment on Overall Survival of Colon Cancer Patients Using Propensity Score Matching. Background  Colon cancer is a common cause of cancer and cancer-associated deaths in the United States. Many factors can influence the overall survival (OS) of patients with colon cancer, such as patient demographics, clinical presentation, and treatment characteristics. The goal of this study was to assess the influence of chemotherapy on OS in patients with colon cancer with similar baseline characteristics.  Materials and methods  A total of 70,876 patients with stage II and III colon cancer, confirmed by pathology, over the age of 18, and who were diagnosed with colon cancer between 2004 and 2019, were selected from the de-identified National Cancer Database (NCDB). All of the patients included in the study underwent surgical treatment. Patients who received hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, immunotherapy, palliative care, or any treatment modality besides chemotherapy were excluded from the analysis. Calculation of the propensity score was performed by computing the probability of patients being in the chemotherapy group using logistic regression. The propensity score matching (PSM) was done via the PSMATCH procedure with the SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) on patients who received chemotherapy compared to patients who received a treatment other than chemotherapy. The greedy nearest neighbor matching method was then utilized to match one chemotherapy patient to one non-chemotherapy patient with a caliper of 0.2. An exact match was done for sex, race, tumor stage, and year diagnosed at the time of patient diagnosis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was then used to estimate the effect of chemotherapy on OS before and after PSM.  Results  A total of 70,876 patients were included in the study before PSM, with 44,992 receiving chemotherapy and 25,884 not receiving chemotherapy. Before PSM, the OS was 17.55 years for patients who received chemotherapy, compared to 14.12 years for those who did not. After matching 23,356 patients, the OS was 17.77 years for patients who received chemotherapy and 12.18 years for those who did not. Following PSM, patients who received chemotherapy were 46% less likely to die compared to those who did not receive chemotherapy. Conclusion  Our findings, per the PSM method, demonstrate that receiving chemotherapy can be a significant predictor of OS among patients with stage II and III colon cancer. Other variables such as tumor stage, age, and insurance type were also found to be significant predictors of OS in colon cancer patients. Prospective clinical studies are necessary and should be performed to determine the true effects of chemotherapy on OS."
0,"Colorectal Cancer Characteristics Among Racial Minorities in the South Bronx: A 10-Year Retrospective Study at a Single Health Center. Background Colon cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The incidence of colorectal cancer has increased with time. Over the last several decades, people of color and racial minorities living in the South Bronx, the poorest congressional district in the United States, have suffered worse health outcomes than their White counterparts on virtually every health indicator. Aim To review the characteristics of patients belonging to racial and ethnic minorities diagnosed with colon cancer at the age of less than 50 and compare it to those who develop colorectal cancer more than or equal to the age of 50 years from a single health center in the South Bronx region. Methods We conducted a single-center, retrospective, observational study of patients who were followed from July 2011 to June 2021 at Bronx Care Health System. Patients aged 18 years and older who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer in our health system were included in the study. Patients younger than 18 years of age, who were pregnant, or who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer at other institutions were excluded. Results A total of 159 patients were included in the study. Gastrointestinal bleeding was the most common clinical presentation in 41 patients (25.8%), while iron deficiency anemia was the most common laboratory finding in 25 patients (15.7%). Sigmoid colon in 42 (26.4%) and ascending colon in 41 (25.8%) patients were the two most common locations of diagnosed colorectal cancers, and about 77 (48.4%) of the patients had stage 3 or 4 colorectal cancer at the time of diagnosis. The result of our study highlights the importance of getting a colonoscopy for colon cancer screening done at the age of 45 years. Sigmoid and ascending colon were found to be the two most common locations of colorectal cancer in our patient population. Most of the patients who present with colon cancer at an early age present at an advanced stage. Close to 63 of the total 159 (39.6%) patients who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer had missed or declined their initial screening colonoscopy when offered. Conclusion Colon cancer is a common but mostly preventable disease, especially in people who are within the recommended age for screening colonoscopies. While gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia are generally the most common symptoms, we have observed that younger patients with colorectal cancer often show signs of weight loss and are typically diagnosed at more advanced stages when they seek medical care."

0,"Age and sex differences in the relationship of body weight changes with colon cancer risks: A nationwide cohort study. Colon cancer is a significant health concern, and obesity is a well-established risk factor. However, previous studies have mainly focused on assessing body weight as a risk factor for colon cancer at a specific time point. This nationwide cohort study investigated the association between body weight changes, which can fluctuate throughout an individual's lifespan, and the incidence of colon cancer using the South Korean population database provided by the National Health Insurance Service (NHIS). Participants who underwent biennial health screenings between 2004 and 2006, and had follow-up health check-ups between 2014 and 2016, were included in this study. Body weight changes were categorized as follows: < 5%, decrease 5-20%, decrease > 20%, increase 5-20%, or > 20%. The primary outcome was the incidence of newly diagnosed colon cancer. Statistical analysis was used to examine the relationship between body weight changes and the incidence of colon cancer stratified according to age and sex. The Kaplan-Meier method estimated the cumulative incidence of colon cancer, and Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusting for confounding factors. The analysis included data from 10,332,397 individuals, with a mean (± SD) age of 45.5 ± 13.1 years, and 54.9% were male. In males with a body mass index (BMI) range of 18-30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, both a weight gain of 5-20% (HR 1.07, P > z 0.01 [95% CI 1.02-1.13]) and weight gain > 20% (HR 1.27, P > z 0.03 [95% CI 1.03-1.56]) were associated with an increased risk for colon cancer. In addition, males < 40 years of age exhibited a higher risk for colon cancer with > 20% weight gain (HR 1.65, P > z < 0.001 [95% CI 1.18-2.30]). Whereas, females within the BMI range of 18-30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> who exhibited > 20% weight loss demonstrated a reduced risk (HR 0.77, P > z 0.04 [95% CI 0.60-0.98]). Moreover, females ≥ 40 years of age, who experienced weight loss > 20%, exhibited a decreased risk for colon cancer (HR 0.76; P > 0.02 [95% CI 0.60-0.96]). This nationwide cohort study demonstrated a relationship between body weight changes and the incidence of colon cancer, with differences based on sex and age. In particular, avoiding weight gain is crucial for males < 40 years of age, whereas weight loss could be beneficial for females > 40 years of age in reducing the risk of colon cancer."
0,"Plasma fatty acids and risk of colon and rectal cancers in the Singapore Chinese Health Study. Fatty acid composition in plasma captures both dietary intake and endogenous synthesis. Prospective analyses of plasma fatty acid composition are needed to establish the role of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on risk of developing colorectal cancer. To evaluate associations between plasma fatty acid composition and colon or rectal cancer risk separately, a nested case-control study of 350 colorectal (211 colon and 139 rectal) cancer cases and an equal number of individually matched control subjects was conducted within the Singapore Chinese Health Study, a cohort of 63,257 men and women recruited between 1993 and 1998. Fatty acids in pre-diagnostic plasma were quantified using gas chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry. Conditional odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) comparing highest to lowest quartiles are presented. For colon cancer, inverse associations were reported with higher essential PUFAs, α-linolenic acid (OR = 0.41; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.73; P;  trend = 0.005) and linoleic acid (OR = 0.43; 95% CI: 0.23, 0.82; P;  trend = 0.008). Higher desaturase activity in the n-6 PUFA synthesis pathway estimated by the arachidonic:linoleic acid ratio was associated with increased colon cancer risk (OR = 3.53; 95% CI: 1.82, 6.85; P;  trend = 0.006), whereas higher desaturase activity in the MUFA synthesis pathway estimated by the oleic:stearic acid ratio was associated with decreased colon cancer risk (OR = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.19, 0.92; P;  trend = 0.024). There was no significant association between the essential fatty acids or the desaturase indices and rectal cancer risk. Endogenous synthesis of arachidonic and oleic acids has an impact on colon cancer development. Higher consumption of “good fats,” or their natural creation by the body, may help protect people from colon cancer. Jian-Min Yuan from the University of Pittsburgh, USA, and colleagues used samples from the Singapore Chinese Health Study to examine fatty acids contained in blood plasma from 350 people who later developed colorectal cancer and an equal number of matched control individuals. They found that higher blood levels—which reflect dietary intake—of the essential polyunsaturated fatty acids linolenic acid and α-linolenic acid were associated with a lower risk of colon cancer. So was oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat created by the body, whereas conversion of linolenic acid to another fatty acid called arachidonic acid boosted colon cancer risk. No effect was seen on rectal cancer risk. Diets rich in linolenic acid may help prevent colon cancer."
0,"Tumor derived exosomal ENTPD2 impair CD8+ T cell function in colon cancer through ATP-adenosine metabolism reprogramming. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Extracellular ATP-AMP-adenosine metabolism plays a pivotal role in modulating tumor immune responses. Previous studies have shown that the conversion of ATP to AMP is primarily catalysed by Ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase 1 (ENTPD1/CD39), a widely studied ATPase, which is expressed in tumor-associated immune cells. However, the function of ATPases derived from tumor cells themselves remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of colon cancer cell-derived ATPases in the development and progression of colon cancer.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">Bioinformatic and tissue microarray analyses were performed to investigate the expression of ATPase family members in colon cancer. An ATP hydrolysis assay, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and CCK8 and colony formation assays were used to determine the effects of ENTPD2 on the biological functions of colon cancer cells. Flow cytometric and RNA-seq analyses were used to explore the function of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Immunoelectron microscopy and western blotting were used to evaluate the expression of ENTPD2 in exosomes. Double-labelling immunofluorescence and western blotting were used to examine the expression of ENTPD2 in serum exosomes and colon cancer tissues.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We found that ENTPD2, rather than the well-known ATPase CD39, is highly expressed in cancer cells and is significantly positively associated with poor patient prognosis in patients with colon cancer. The overexpression of ENTPD2 in cancer cells augmented tumor progression in immunocompetent mice by inhibiting the function of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Moreover, ENTPD2 is localized primarily within exosomes. On the one hand, exosomal ENTPD2 reduces extracellular ATP levels, thereby inhibiting P2X7R-mediated NFATc1 nuclear transcription; on the other hand, it facilitates the increased conversion of ATP to adenosine, hence promoting adenosine-A2AR pathway activity. In patients with colon cancer, the serum level of exosomal ENTPD2 is positively associated with advanced TNM stage and high tumor invasion depth. Moreover, the level of ENTPD2 in the serum exosomes of colon cancer patients is positively correlated with the ENTPD2 expression level in paired colon cancer tissues, and the ENTPD2 level in both serum exosomes and tissues is significantly negatively correlated with the ENTPD2 expression level in tumor-infiltrating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Our study suggests that exosomal ENTPD2, originated from colon cancer cells, contributes to the immunosuppressive microenvironment by promoting ATP-adenosine metabolism.

0,"The effect of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) status on oxaliplatin-based first-line chemotherapy as in recurrent or metastatic colon cancer Colon cancer with DNA mismatch repair (MMR) defects reveals distinct clinical and pathologic features, including a better prognosis but reduced response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy. A current standard treatment for recurrent or metastatic colon cancer uses capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CAPOX), or continuous-infusion fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX). This study investigated the effect of MMR status on the treatment outcomes for CAPOX and FOLFOX as first-line combination chemotherapy in recurrent or metastatic colon cancer. We analyzed 171 patients who had been treated with CAPOX or FOLFOX as first-line combination chemotherapy in recurrent or metastatic colon adenocarcinoma between February 2004 and July 2008. Tumor expression of the MMR proteins, MLH1 and MSH2, was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in surgically resected tumor specimens. The microsatellite instability (MSI) was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, using fluorescent dye-labeled primers specific to microsatellite loci. Tumors with MMR defect were defined as those demonstrating a loss of MMR protein expression (MMR-D) and/or a microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) genotype. In all, 75 patients (44%) received FOLFOX, and 96 patients (56%) received CAPOX as first-line combination chemotherapy. The incidence of colon cancer with MMR defect was 10/171 (6%). Colon cancers with MMR defect (MSI-H and/or MMR-D) are more commonly located in proximal to the splenic flexure (p = 0.03). The MMR status did not significantly influence the overall response (p = 0.95) to first-line CAPOX or FOLFOX treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic colon cancer. According to the MMR status, there was no significant difference for PFS (p = 0.50) and OS (p = 0.47) in patients with recurrent or metastatic colon cancer treated with first-line CAPOX or FOLFOX. In colon cancers with MMR defect, there was no significant difference for PFS (p = 0.48) and OS (p = 0.56) between CAPOX and FOLFOX as first-line combination chemotherapy. However, in MMR intact, there was significant difference for OS between CAPOX and FOLFOX (p = 0.04). OS was significantly better in patients treated with CAPOX when compared to patients with FOLFOX. The MMR status does not predict the effect of oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy as 1st line in recurrent or metastatic colon cancers. CAPOX in the first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic colon cancer with MMR intacts showed a superior OS compared with FOLFOX unlike colon cancer with MMR defects."
0,"Risk Factors, Clinical Manifestations and Treatment Outcomes of Colon Cancer Patients in National Guard Hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Introduction; ; Colon cancer is the third most common cancer worldwide and its incidence is increasing day by day. Provision of early management to cancer patients can lead to a good prognosis. Hence, we evaluated the risk factors, clinical manifestations and treatment outcomes for colon cancer patients in National Guard Health Affairs (NGHA), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia from January 2010 to December 2020 by comparing those results according to their age groups.; ; Methods; ; A retrospective cohort study was performed on 251 colon cancer patients who underwent a surgical procedure. The patients were divided into the following age groups: ≤ 50 (young), 51-60 and > 60 (old) years old. The demographic variables such as age and gender were collected. The results were classified into risk factors, clinical features and treatment outcomes. The comparison between different age groups was made using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test. The data was stored in Excel 2016 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, USA) and analyzed using SPSS (IBM Corp, Armonk, USA).; ; Results; ; The results revealed that most patients were males and the median age for diagnosis was 58 years old. There were 15.1% of patients with a positive family history. Moreover, the most common anatomical position was the left side of the colon in all age groups. Most patients had moderately differentiated colon cancer in the histopathological diagnosis. Laparotomy was the most common procedure done to patients in all age groups. There was no difference between all age groups and the aggressiveness of colon cancer. Young patients (≤ 50 years) had a higher percentage to have 5-year recurrence rate (42 % vs 19% vs 25%, p-value  60 years) respectively. However, there was no association between all age groups and 5-year mortality rate (22% vs 9% vs 19%, p-value = 0.171).; ; Conclusion; ; In comparison to old patients (> 60 years), young patients (≤ 50 years) have a more rate of recurrent colon cancer. In relation to all age groups, there were no differences in terms of the aggressive presentation or 5-year mortality rates. In addition, it appears that there were some differences between our study results and worldwide results. This may be because of occupational, cultural and/or genetic variations. Further studies with a higher number of patients and multicenter data collection are highly recommended."
0,"Association between heavy metals and colon cancer: an ecological study based on geographical information systems in North-Eastern Iran Colorectal cancer has increased in Middle Eastern countries and exposure to environmental pollutants such as heavy metals has been implicated. However, data linking them to this disease are generally lacking. This study aimed to explore the spatial pattern of age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) of colon cancer and its potential association with the exposure level of the amount of heavy metals existing in rice produced in north-eastern Iran. Cancer data were drawn from the Iranian population-based cancer registry of Golestan Province, north-eastern Iran. Samples of 69 rice milling factories were analysed for the concentration levels of cadmium, nickel, cobalt, copper, selenium, lead and zinc. The inverse distance weighting (IDW) algorithm was used to interpolate the concentration of this kind of heavy metals on the surface of the study area. Exploratory regression analysis was conducted to build ordinary least squares (OLS) models including every possible combination of the candidate explanatory variables and chose the most useful ones to show the association between heavy metals and the ASR of colon cancer. The highest concentrations of heavy metals were found in the central part of the province and particularly counties with higher amount of cobalt were shown to be associated with higher ASR of men with colon cancer. In contrast, selenium concentrations were higher in areas with lower ASR of colon cancer in men. A significant regression equation for men with colon cancer was found (F(4,137) = 38.304, P < .000) with an adjusted R2 of 0.77. The predicted ASR of men colon cancer was − 58.36 with the coefficients for cobalt = 120.33; cadmium = 80.60; selenium = − 6.07; nickel = − 3.09; and zinc = − 0.41. The association of copper and lead with colon cancer in men was not significant. We did not find a significant outcome for colon cancer in women. Increased amounts of heavy metals in consumed rice may impact colon cancer incidence, both positively and negatively. While there were indications of an association between high cobalt concentrations and an increased risk for colon cancer, we found that high selenium concentrations might instead decrease the risk. Further investigations are needed to clarify if there are ecological or other reasons for these discrepancies. Regular monitoring of the amount of heavy metals in consumed rice is recommended."
0,"Understanding the impact of colorectal cancer education: a randomized trial of health fairs Regular screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) reduces morbidity and mortality from this disease. A number of factors play a role in the underutilization of CRC screening; populations with the lowest CRC screening rates are least likely to be aware of the need for screening or have knowledge about screening options. The overall purpose of this project was to assess two methods for increasing knowledge about CRC in a health fair context: one, by using a health educator to provide CRC information at a table, or two, to provide a tour through a giant inflatable, walk-through colon model with physical depictions of healthy tissue, polyps, and CRC. We participated in six community health fair events, three were randomized to incorporate the use of the inflatable colon, and three used a standard display table method. We used a pre/post-design to look for changes in knowledge about CRC before and after participating in a health fair. We examined descriptive statistics of participants using frequencies and proportions. McNemar’s test for paired binary data was used to test whether there were significant differences in the distribution of correct answer percentage from pre to post and from pre to follow up. Linear regression (GEE) was used to investigate whether there was a significant difference in the change from pre- to post-intervention in the percentage of correct answers on knowledge of tests available to detect CRC and awareness of risk factors for CRC between participants at sites with the inflatable colon compared to participants at sites without the inflatable colon. Participants (n = 273) were recruited at the six health fairs. Participants in health fairs with the inflatable colon had higher knowledge at post-test than participants in health fairs with tabling activities, that is, without the inflatable colon; however, the difference was not significant. One month follow-up after each health fair showed virtually no recollection of information learned at the health fairs. The use of an inflatable colon may be an innovative way to help people learn about CRC and CRC screening; however, it is not significantly more effective than conventional table display methods. Further research is needed to associate intention to obtain screening after touring the inflatable colon with actual screening. Future research could explore ways to better retain knowledge at long-term follow-up."
0,"Epistasis analysis of microRNAs on pathological stages in colon cancer based on an Empirical Bayesian Elastic Net method. Colon cancer is a leading cause of worldwide cancer death. It has become clear that microRNAs (miRNAs) play a role in the progress of colon cancer and understanding the effect of miRNAs on tumorigenesis could lead to better prognosis and improved treatment. However, most studies have focused on studying differentially expressed miRNAs between tumor and non-tumor samples or between stages in tumor tissue. Limited work has conducted to study the interactions or epistasis between miRNAs and how the epistasis brings about effect on tumor progression. In this study, we investigate the main and pair-wise epistatic effects of miRNAs on the pathological stages of colon cancer ﻿using datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas. We develop a workflow composed of multiple steps for feature selection based on the Empirical Bayesian Elastic Net (EBEN) method. First, we identify the main effects using a model with only main effect on the phenotype. Second, a corrected phenotype is calculated by removing the significant main effect from the original phenotype. Third, we select features with epistatic effect on the corrected phenotype. Finally, we run the full model with main and epistatic effects on the previously selected main and epistatic features. Using the multi-step workflow, we identify a set of miRNAs with main and epistatic effect on the pathological stages of colon cancer. Many of miRNAs with main effect on colon cancer have been previously reported to be associated with colon cancer, and the majority of the epistatic miRNAs share common target genes that could explain their epistasis effect on the pathological stages of colon cancer. We also find many of the target genes of detected miRNAs are associated with colon cancer. Go Ontology Enrichment Analysis of the experimentally validates targets of main and epistatic miRNAs, shows that these target genes are enriched for biological processes associated with cancer progression. Our results provide a set of candidate miRNAs associated with colon cancer progression that could have potential translational and therapeutic utility. Our analysis workflow offers a new opportunity to efficiently explore epistatic interactions among genetic and epigenetic factors that could be associated with human diseases. Furthermore, our workflow is flexible and can be applied to analyze the main and epistatic effect of various genetic and epigenetic factors on a wide range of phenotypes."

0,"Tumor size and origin determine the antitumor activity of cisplatin or 5-fluorouracil and its modulation by leucovorin in murine colon carcinomas. 5-Fluorouracil (FUra) is one of the few effective agents in the treatment of patients with colorectal cancer. Its effects on the target enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS) can be modulated by leucovorin (LV) or cisplatin (CDDP). Tumor size and differentiation of tumor characteristics can influence therapeutic efficacy. We therefore studied the relationship between tumor size (cutoff point 200 mm3) and the antitumor activity of FUra and its modulation by LV in murine Colon 26 and Colon 38 tumors. The doubling time of tumors measuring >200 mm3 was about 160% longer. The antitumor effect of FUra in these large tumors was decreased and could not be modulated by LV. In addition, three subtypes of Colon 26 (Colon 26-A, Colon 26-B, and Colon 26-10) were identified and characterized for tumor-induced weight loss, TS activity, response to chemotherapy, and histological features. Mice bearing Colon 38 and Colon 26-10 did not lose weight as a result of tumor growth. Colon 26-A caused a weight loss of up to 19%, whereas mice with Colon 26-B tumors remained within 10% of their initial weight and tolerated at least 2.5 times more tumor load than did mice bearing Colon 26-A, which induces cachexia. Among untreated tumors, TS catalytic activity was highest in Colon 26-B (5536 pmol mg protein-1 h-1) and lowest in Colon 38 (799 pmol mg protein-1 h-1); Colon 26-A and Colon 26-10 had intermediate activities (about 2500 pmol mg protein-1 h-1). 5-Fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP) binding was comparable in the three Colon 26 subtypes but was lower in Colon 38. The antitumor activity of FUra could be modulated by LV in Colon 38, Colon 26-10, and Colon 26-A but could not in Colon 26-B, with complete responses (CR) being obtained in Colon 26-10 and Colon 38. The latter two were highly sensitive to CDDP, followed by Colon 26-A and Colon 26-B (CRs: 50%, 40%, 25%, and 0, respectively). Furthermore, necrosis was noted in Colon 26-B and Colon 38 but not in Colon 26-A. In conclusion, (1) the antitumor activity of FUra in large tumors is decreased and cannot be modulated by LV and (2) characteristics and sensitivity to chemotherapeutics can vary substantially in closely related tumors of the same origin."
0,"Consumption of red meat and processed meat and cancer incidence: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies. Red meat and processed meat consumption has been hypothesized to increase risk of cancer, but the evidence is inconsistent. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies to summarize the evidence of associations between consumption of red meat (unprocessed), processed meat, and total red and processed meat with the incidence of various cancer types. We searched in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases through December 2020. Using a random-effect meta-analysis, we calculated the pooled relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of the highest versus the lowest category of red meat, processed meat, and total red and processed meat consumption in relation to incidence of various cancers. We identified 148 published articles. Red meat consumption was significantly associated with greater risk of breast cancer (RR = 1.09; 95% CI = 1.03–1.15), endometrial cancer (RR = 1.25; 95% CI = 1.01-1.56), colorectal cancer (RR = 1.10; 95% CI = 1.03–1.17), colon cancer (RR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.09-1.25), rectal cancer (RR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.01-1.46), lung cancer (RR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.09–1.44), and hepatocellular carcinoma (RR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.01-1.46). Processed meat consumption was significantly associated with a 6% greater breast cancer risk, an 18% greater colorectal cancer risk, a 21% greater colon cancer risk, a 22% greater rectal cancer risk, and a 12% greater lung cancer risk. Total red and processed meat consumption was significantly associated with greater risk of colorectal cancer (RR = 1.17; 95% CI = 1.08–1.26), colon cancer (RR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.09–1.34), rectal cancer (RR = 1.26; 95% CI = 1.09–1.45), lung cancer (RR = 1.20; 95% CI = 1.09-1.33), and renal cell cancer (RR = 1.19; 95% CI = 1.04–1.37). This comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis study showed that high red meat intake was positively associated with risk of breast cancer, endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, colon cancer, rectal cancer, lung cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and high processed meat intake was positively associated with risk of breast, colorectal, colon, rectal, and lung cancers. Higher risk of colorectal, colon, rectal, lung, and renal cell cancers were also observed with high total red and processed meat consumption."
0,"Which is more important in the management of splenic flexure colon cancer: strict central lymph node dissection or adequate bowel resection margin? What qualifies as optimal lymph node (LN) dissection in the surgical management of splenic flexure colon cancer (SFCC) still remains controversial because few studies have evaluated the distribution of LN metastasis of SFCC. The aim of this study was to clarify detailed distribution of LN metastasis and long-term outcomes of SFCC. This retrospective study enrolled patients who had curative colectomy for primary transverse or descending colon cancer of pathological stage I, II, or III at a single high-volume cancer center between April 2002 and December 2018. The 538 eligible patients were divided into three groups: patients with SFCC (SFCC group, n = 168), patients with proximal transverse colon cancer (PTCC group, n = 290), and patients with distal descending colon cancer (DDCC group, n = 80). LNs were classified into horizontal (pericolic) and vertical (intermediate and main) nodes. Intermediate and main LN station numbers were defined according to the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum classification. Distributions of LN metastasis and long-term outcomes were compared. In the SFCC group, the mean age was 67.3 ± 10.5 years and 110 patients (65.5%) were male. The proportion of patients with LN metastasis in the intermediate or main region was significantly lower in the SFCC group (8%) than in the PTCC (37%) (p < 0.01) or DDCC group (29%) (p < 0.01) in pathological stage III patients. In the SFCC group, the incidence of pericolic LN metastasis on the oral side of tumor (43%) was significantly higher than in the PTCC group (21%) (p < 0.01) and was similar to that in the DDCC group (42%) (p = 0.51), while in the SFCC group, the incidence of pericolic LN metastasis on the anal side of tumor (17%) was lower than in the PTCC group (31%) and was also similar to that in the DDCC group (21%). There were no significant differences in disease-specific survival rates among all groups. LN metastasis occurred mainly in the pericolic region, especially on the oral side of the tumor in SFCC. It may, therefore, be important to have an adequate bowel resection margin, especially on the oral side, for SFCC."

0,"Translationally controlled tumour protein TCTP is induced early in human colorectal tumours and contributes to the resistance of HCT116 colon cancer cells to 5-FU and oxaliplatin. Translationally controlled tumour protein TCTP is an anti-apoptotic protein frequently overexpressed in cancers, where high levels are often associated with poor patient outcome. TCTP may be involved in protecting cancer cells against the cytotoxic action of anti-cancer drugs. Here we study the early increase of TCTP levels in human colorectal cancer (CRC) and the regulation of TCTP expression in HCT116 colon cancer cells, in response to treatment with the anti-cancer drugs 5-FU and oxaliplatin. Using immunohistochemistry, we assessed TCTP levels in surgical samples from adenomas and adenocarcinomas of the colon, compared to normal colon tissue. We also studied the regulation of TCTP in HCT116 colon cancer cells in response to 5-FU and oxaliplatin by western blotting. TCTP mRNA levels were assessed by RT-qPCR. We used mTOR kinase inhibitors to demonstrate mTOR-dependent translational regulation of TCTP under these conditions. Employing the Real-Time Cell Analysis (RTCA) System and the MTS assay, we investigated the effect of TCTP-knockdown on the sensitivity of HCT116 cells to the anti-cancer drugs 5-FU and oxaliplatin. 1.

TCTP protein levels are about 4-fold upregulated in HCT116 colon cancer cells, in response to 5-FU and oxaliplatin treatment, whereas TCTP mRNA levels are down regulated. 3. mTOR kinase inhibitors prevented the up-regulation of TCTP protein, indicating that TCTP is translationally regulated through the mTOR complex 1 signalling pathway under these conditions. 4. Using two cellular assay systems, we demonstrated that TCTP-knockdown sensitises HCT116 cells to the cytotoxicity caused by 5-FU and oxaliplatin. Our results demonstrate that TCTP levels increase significantly in the early stages of CRC development. In colon cancer cells, expression of this protein is largely upregulated during treatment with the DNA-damaging anti-cancer drugs 5-FU and oxaliplatin, as part of the cellular stress response. TCTP may thus contribute to the development of anti-cancer drug resistance. These findings indicate that TCTP might be suitable as a biomarker and that combinatorial treatment using 5-FU/oxaliplatin, together with mTOR kinase inhibitors, could be a route to preventing the development of resistance to these drugs."
0,"The Swedish Family-Cancer Database: Update, Application to Colorectal Cancer and Clinical Relevance The Swedish Family-Cancer Database has been used for almost 10 years in the study of familial risks at all common sites. In the present paper we describe some main features of version VI of this Database, assembled in 2004. This update included all Swedes born in 1932 and later (offspring) with their biological parents, a total of 10.5 million individuals. Cancer cases were retrieved from the Swedish Cancer Registry from 1958-2002, including over 1.2 million first and multiple primary cancers and in situ tumours. Compared to previous versions, only 6.0% of deceased offspring with a cancer diagnosis lack any parental information. We show one application of the Database in the study of familial risks in colorectal adenocarcinoma, with defined age-group and anatomic site specific analyses. Familial standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were determined for offspring when parents or sibling were diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer. As a novel finding it was shown that risks for siblings were higher than those for offspring of affected parents. The excess risk was limited to colon cancer and particularly to right-sided colon cancer. The SIRs for colon cancer in age matched populations were 2.58 when parents were probands and 3.81 when siblings were probands; for right-sided colon cancer the SIRs were 3.66 and 7.53, respectively. Thus the familial excess (SIR-1.00) was more than two fold higher for right-sided colon cancer. Colon and rectal cancers appeared to be distinguished between high-penetrant and recessive conditions that only affect the colon, whereas low-penetrant familial effects are shared by the two sites. Epidemiological studies can be used to generate clinical estimates for familial risk, conditioned on numbers of affected family members and their ages of onset. Useful risk estimates have been developed for familial breast and prostate cancers. Reliable risk estimates for other cancers should also be seriously considered for routine clinical recommendations, because practically all cancers show a familial effect and the risks are high for some of the rare neoplasms. The implementation of a unified management plan for familial cancers at large will be a major challenge to the clinical genetic counselling community."
0,"A transcriptome-based protein network that identifies new therapeutic targets in colorectal cancer. Colon cancer occurrence is increasing worldwide, making it the third most frequent cancer. Although many therapeutic options are available and quite efficient at the early stages, survival is strongly decreased when the disease has spread to other organs. The identification of molecular markers of colon cancer is likely to help understanding its course and, eventually, to uncover novel genes to be targeted by drugs. In this study, we compared gene expression in a set of 95 human colon cancer samples to that in 19 normal colon mucosae, focusing on 401 genes from 5 selected pathways (Apoptosis, Cancer, Cholesterol metabolism and lipoprotein signaling, Drug metabolism, Wnt/beta-catenin). Deregulation of mRNA levels largely matched that of proteins, leading us to build in silico protein networks, starting from mRNA levels, to identify key proteins central to network activity. Among the analyzed genes, 10.5% (42) had no reported link with colon cancer, including the SFRP1, IGF1 and ADH1B (down), and MYC and IL8 (up), whose encoded proteins were most interacting with other proteins from the same or even distinct networks. Analyzing all pathways globally led us to uncover novel functional links between a priori unrelated or rather remotely connected pathways, such as the Drug metabolism and the Cancer pathways or, even more strikingly, between the Cholesterol metabolism and lipoprotein signaling and the Cancer pathways. In addition, we analyzed the responsiveness of some of the deregulated genes essential to network activities, to chemotherapeutic agents used alone or in presence of Lovastatin, a lipid-lowering drug. Some of these treatments could oppose the deregulations occurring in cancer samples, including those of the CHECK2, CYP51A1, HMGCS1, ITGA2, NME1 or VEGFA genes. Our network-based approach allowed discovering genes not previously known to play regulatory roles in colon cancer. Our results also showed that selected drug treatments might revert the cancer-specific deregulation of genes playing prominent roles within the networks operating to maintain colon homeostasis. Among those genes, some could constitute novel testable targets to eliminate colon cancer cells, either directly or, potentially, through the use of lipid-lowering drugs such as statins, in association with selected anticancer drugs."
0,"Overexpression of peptide deformylase in breast, colon, and lung cancers Human mitochondrial peptide deformylase (PDF) has been proposed as a novel cancer therapeutic target. However, very little is known about its expression and regulation in human tissues. The purpose of this study was to characterize the expression pattern of PDF in cancerous tissues and to identify mechanisms that regulate its expression. The mRNA expression levels of PDF and methionine aminopeptidase 1D (MAP1D), an enzyme involved in a related pathway with PDF, were determined using tissue panels containing cDNA from patients with various types of cancer (breast, colon, kidney, liver, lung, ovarian, prostate, or thyroid) and human cell lines. Protein levels of PDF were also determined in 2 colon cancer patients via western blotting. Colon cancer cells were treated with inhibitors of ERK, Akt, and mTOR signaling pathways and the resulting effects on PDF and MAP1D mRNA levels were determined by qPCR for colon and lung cancer cell lines. Finally, the effects of a PDF inhibitor, actinonin, on the proliferation of breast, colon, and prostate cell lines were determined using the CyQUANT assay. PDF and MAP1D mRNA levels were elevated in cancer cell lines compared to non-cancer lines. PDF mRNA levels were significantly increased in breast, colon, and lung cancer samples while MAP1D mRNA levels were increased in just colon cancers. The expression of PDF and MAP1D varied with stage in these cancers. Further, PDF protein expression was elevated in colon cancer tissue samples. Inhibition of the MEK/ERK, but not PI3K or mTOR, pathway reduced the expression of PDF and MAP1D in both colon and lung cancer cell lines. Further, inhibition of PDF with actinonin resulted in greater reduction of breast, colon, and prostate cancer cell proliferation than non-cancer cell lines. This is the first report showing that PDF is over-expressed in breast, colon, and lung cancers, and the first evidence that the MEK/ERK pathway plays a role in regulating the expression of PDF and MAP1D. The over-expression of PDF in several cancers and the inhibition of cancer cell growth by a PDF inhibitor suggest this enzyme may act as an oncogene to promote cancer cell proliferation."

Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that GABA-induced colon cancer metastasis is associated with enhanced recruitment of macrophages in the lungs. The co-culture results showed that GABA intensified M2 polarization of macrophage induced by colon cancer cells. This effect is due to the activation of the macrophage MAPK pathway by tumor-derived exosomal miR-223-3p. Furthermore, M2-like macrophages promote tumor proliferation and migration by secreting IL-17. We also identified an endogenous miR-223-3p downregulation of the E3 ligase CBLB, which enhances the stability of cMYC protein and augments colon cancer cells proliferation and migration ability. Notably, cMYC acts as a transcription factor and can also regulate the expression of miR-223-3p.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our results suggest that sleep deprivation can promote the expression of miR-223-3p in colon cancer cells through GABA, leading to downregulation of the E3 ligase CBLB and inhibition of cMYC ubiquitination.

0,"WDR5 supports colon cancer cells by promoting methylation of H3K4 and suppressing DNA damage KMT2/MLL proteins are commonly overexpressed or mutated in cancer and have been shown to support cancer maintenance. These proteins are responsible for methylating histone 3 at lysine 4 and promoting transcription and DNA synthesis; however, they are inactive outside of a multi-protein complex that requires WDR5. WDR5 has been implicated in cancer for its role in the COMPASS complex and its interaction with Myc; however, the role of WDR5 in colon cancer has not yet been elucidated. WDR5 expression was evaluated using RT-qPCR and western blot analysis. Cell viability and colony forming assays were utilized to evaluate the effects of WDR5 depletion or inhibition in colon cancer cells. Downstream effects of WDR5 depletion and inhibition were observed by western blot. WDR5 is overexpressed in colon tumors and colon cancer cell lines at the mRNA and protein level. WDR5 depletion reduces cell viability in HCT116, LoVo, RKO, HCT15, SW480, SW620, and T84 colon cancer cells. Inhibition of the WDR5:KMT2/MLL interaction using OICR-9429 reduces cell viability in the same panel of cell lines albeit not to the same extent as RNAi-mediated WDR5 depletion. WDR5 depletion reduced H3K4Me3 and increased phosphorylation of H2AX in HCT116, SW620, and RKO colon cancer cells; however, OICR-9429 treatment did not recapitulate these effects in all cell lines potentially explaining the reduced toxicity of OICR-9429 treatment as compared to WDR5 depletion. WDR5 depletion also sensitized colon cancer cells to radiation-induced DNA damage. These data demonstrate a clear role for WDR5 in colon cancer and future studies should examine its potential to serve as a therapeutic target in cancer. Additional studies are needed to fully elucidate if the requirement for WDR5 is independent of or consistent with its role within the COMPASS complex. OICR-9429 treatment was particularly toxic to SW620 and T84 colon cancer cells, two cell lines without mutations in WDR5 and KMT2/MLL proteins suggesting COMPASS complex inhibition may be particularly effective in tumors lacking KMT2 mutations. Additionally, the ability of WDR5 depletion to amplify the toxic effects of radiation presents the possibility of targeting WDR5 to sensitize cells to DNA-damaging therapies."

Gain- and loss-of function experiments, luciferase reporter assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, and immunohistochemistry assays were performed to reveal the cross-talk between colon cancer cells and Schwann cells. Furthermore, colon cancer cells co-cultured with Schwann cells were transplanted into nude mice for evaluating their effect on tumor proliferation and metastasis in vivo.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The clinicopathological characteristics indicated that Schwann cells were enriched in colon cancer tissues and were associated with tumor metastasis and poor prognosis. The co-culture of Schwann cells with colon cancer cells promoted the proliferation and migration of colon cancer cells and Schwann cells, which was mediated by nerve growth factor (NGF) secreted from Schwann cells. Exosomal miR-21-5p released by colon cancer cells inhibited VHL expression in Schwann cells, which in turn stabilized the HIF-1α protein and increased the transcription of NGF. Meanwhile, the Schwann cells-derived NGF activated TrkA/ERK/ELK1/ZEB1 signaling pathway in colon cancer cells, which further enhanced the expression of exosomal miR-21-5p. Inhibition of either NGF or miR-21-5p significantly inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of transplanted colon cancer cells in nude mice.

0,"Butyrate inhibits pro-proliferative miR-92a by diminishing c-Myc-induced miR-17-92a cluster transcription in human colon cancer cells Compromised colonic butyrate production resulting from low dietary fiber or altered gut microbiota may promote colon neoplasia. Previous reports indicate these actions are mediated in part by altered levels of miRNAs, including suppressed expression of the oncogenic miR-17-92a cluster. Here, we sought to identify the mechanisms underlying these effects of butyrate in colon cancer. miR-92a levels were measured in archived human colon cancer and adjacent normal colon specimens by microarray and quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR). The effects of butyrate and other histone deacetylase inhibitors (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and valproic acid) on primary (pri-miR17-92a), precursor and mature miR-92a were analyzed in HCT-116 and HT-29 human colon cancer cells using qPCR. The effects of butyrate, SAHA and valproic acid on protein levels of c-Myc, Drosha and p57 were measured in HCT-116 cells using immunoblotting. Regulation of C13orf25 promoter activity by butyrate was analyzed by luciferase reporter assay using modified pGL3 constructs containing a wild-type or mutated c-Myc binding site. Expression of c-Myc was modulated using siRNA or adenovirus vectors. p57 mRNA and protein were measured before and after transfection with miR-92a-mimic molecules. Following butyrate treatment and miR-92a-mimic transfection, apoptosis was analyzed by TUNEL staining and caspase-3 immunoblotting. Microarray, confirmed by qPCR, revealed a seven-fold increase in miR-92a levels in sporadic human colon cancer tissue compared to adjacent normal colon. Treating human colon cancer cells with butyrate reduced the levels of pri-miR17-92a, precursor and mature miR-92a, as well as c-Myc. SAHA and valproic acid had similar effects. Mutation of the c-Myc binding site diminished butyrate’s inhibitory effects on C13orf25 promoter activity. Silencing c-Myc expression reduced miR-92a levels. c-Myc over-expression neutralized butyrate-induced attenuation of pri-miR17-92a. Exogenous miR-92a inhibited butyrate-induced p57 expression and reversed the beneficial actions of butyrate on colon cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis. Our findings identify a novel cellular mechanism whereby butyrate inhibits miR-92a transcription by reducing c-Myc, thus augmenting p57 levels. These actions diminish colon cancer cell proliferation and stimulate apoptosis. This newly described regulation of oncogenic miRNA biogenesis expands our understanding of colon cancer cell biology and identifies novel therapeutic targets."
0,"Four cases of laparoscopic colectomy for sigmoid colon and rectal cancer with persistent descending mesocolon Persistent descending mesocolon (PDM) is a congenital anomaly associated with the failure of fixation of the descending colon to the lateral abdominal wall. In the laparoscopic colectomy for colorectal cancer, it has been noticed that there are extensive adhesions and a distinctive anatomy of colonic vessels in cases with PDM. Therefore, it is necessary to have sufficient knowledge about PDM so that it can be appropriately treated during surgery. Case 1—a 79-year-old man underwent laparoscopic intersphincteric resection for rectal cancer. Preoperative barium enema (BE) revealed that the sigmoid colon was located at the right side of the abdomen. An enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed that the common trunk of the left colic artery (LCA) and the first sigmoid colonic artery (S1) branched from the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). Case 2—a 68-year-old man underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy for sigmoid colon cancer and laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer synchronously. BE showed that the descending colon ran from the splenic flexure to medial caudal side. An enhanced CT showed that the distance from the LCA to the marginal artery was 1.0 cm. Case 3—a 68-year-old man underwent laparoscopic low anterior resection for rectal cancer. BE showed that the descending colon ran to the medial caudal side. An enhanced CT showed that the mesentery of the descending colon was comparatively shortened. Case 4—a 60-year-old man underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy for sigmoid colon cancer. An enhanced CT showed that the descending colon ran to the medial caudal side and predicted that the LCA and S1 formed a common trunk and branched radially from the IMA. We reported four cases with PDM recognized preoperatively as above. Three cases had a shortening of the mesocolon. While dissecting the vessels, although special attention was required to maintain the blood flow to the intestine, none of these cases developed any complications during the postoperative course. We considered that it is important to have positional awareness of the LCA and the marginal artery to perform the laparoscopic surgery safely when a colorectal cancer with PDM is diagnosed preoperatively using imaging methods."

0,"Transcription factor expression as a predictor of colon cancer prognosis: a machine learning practice Colon cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in the USA and around the world. Molecular level characters, such as gene expression levels and mutations, may provide profound information for precision treatment apart from pathological indicators. Transcription factors function as critical regulators in all aspects of cell life, but transcription factors-based biomarkers for colon cancer prognosis were still rare and necessary. We implemented an innovative process to select the transcription factors variables and evaluate the prognostic prediction power by combining the Cox PH model with the random forest algorithm. We picked five top-ranked transcription factors and built a prediction model by using Cox PH regression. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, we validated our predictive model on four independent publicly available datasets (GSE39582, GSE17536, GSE37892, and GSE17537) from the GEO database, consisting of 925 colon cancer patients. A five-transcription-factors based predictive model for colon cancer prognosis has been developed by using TCGA colon cancer patient data. Five transcription factors identified for the predictive model is HOXC9, ZNF556, HEYL, HOXC4 and HOXC6. The prediction power of the model is validated with four GEO datasets consisting of 1584 patient samples. Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank tests were conducted on both training and validation datasets, the difference of overall survival time between predicted low and high-risk groups can be clearly observed. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed to further investigate the difference between low and high-risk groups in the gene pathway level. The biological meaning was interpreted. Overall, our results prove our prediction model has a strong prediction power on colon cancer prognosis. Transcription factors can be used to construct colon cancer prognostic signatures with strong prediction power. The variable selection process used in this study has the potential to be implemented in the prognostic signature discovery of other cancer types. Our five TF-based predictive model would help with understanding the hidden relationship between colon cancer patient survival and transcription factor activities. It will also provide more insights into the precision treatment of colon cancer patients from a genomic information perspective."
0,"Family history of cancer and risk of colorectal cancer in Italy Subjects with a family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) are at increased risk of CRC, but quantification of the risk in different populations, the possible differences in risk according to localization of the cancer and the association of family history of other cancers with CRC risk are still open issues. We have therefore analysed data from a multicentric case-control study conducted in six Italian areas between 1992 and 1996 of 1225 incident cases of colon cancer, 728 cases of rectal cancer and 4154 controls admitted for acute conditions to the same network of hospitals as the cases. Unconditional logistic regression models including terms for gender, age, study centre, years of education and number of siblings were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) of CRC according to various aspects of history of CRC and other cancers in first-degree relatives. The OR for family history of CRC was 3.2 (95% confidence interval, CI, 2.5-4.1) for colon cancer and 2.2 (95% CI 1.6-3.1) for rectal cancer. Colon cancer was significantly associated with a family history of stomach (OR 1.4), bone (OR 2.1) and kidney (OR 2.3) cancers, while rectal cancer was significantly associated with a family history of lymphomas (OR 2.8). There was a 30% higher risk of colon and rectal cancer in subjects with a family history of any cancer, excluding intestine. The ORs for family history of CRC were 5.2 for colon and 6.3 for rectum when the proband's age was below 45 years. The ORs were similar when the affected relative was a parent or a sibling and in different strata of age of relative(s). For subjects with two or more first-degree relatives with CRC, the risk was 6.9 for the right colon, 5.8 for the transverse and descending colon, 3.8 for the sigma, 3.2 for the rectosigmoid junction and 1.9 for the rectum. This study confirms that a family history of CRC in first-degree relatives increases the risk of both colon and rectal cancer, the association being stronger at younger ages and for right colon."
0,"A steep increase in healthcare seeking behaviour in the last months before colorectal cancer diagnosis BACKGROUND Timely recognition of colorectal cancer related symptoms is essential to reduce time to diagnosis. This study aims to investigate the primary healthcare use preceding a colorectal cancer diagnosis. METHODS From a cohort of linked cancer and primary care data, patients diagnosed with primary colorectal cancer in the period 2007-2014 were selected and matched to cancer-free controls on gender, birth year, GP practice and follow-up period. Primary healthcare use among colorectal cancer cases before diagnosis was compared with matched cancer-free controls. Mean monthly number of GP consultations and newly prescribed medication was assessed in the year before index date (diagnosis date for cases). Results were stratified by colorectal cancer site: proximal colon cancer, distal colon cancer and rectal cancer. RESULTS A total of 6,087 colorectal cancer cases could be matched to four cancer-free controls (N = 24,348). While mean monthly number of GP consultation were stable through the year among cancer-free controls, a statistical significant increase was seen among colorectal cancer cases in the last 4-8 months before diagnosis. Proximal colon cancer cases showed the longest time interval of increased mean monthly number of GP consultations. This increase was largely driven by a consultation for malignant neoplasm colon/rectum. The number patients receiving a newly prescribed medication was stable around 120 per 1,000 persons per month until 8 months before index date for proximal colon cancer cases, 4 months before index date for distal colon cancer cases and 3 months for rectal cancer cases. This increase was mainly driven by the prescription of laxatives drugs. CONCLUSION An increase in the healthcare seeking behaviour of colorectal cancer patients prior to diagnosis was seen. The longest period of increased GP consultations and newly prescribed medication was seen among patients diagnosed with proximal colon cancer. This can be explained by the difficultly to diagnose proximal colon cancer given the more subtle signs compared to distal colon cancer and rectal cancer. Therefore, faster diagnosis for this specific tumour subtype may only be possible when clear clinical signs and symptoms are present."
0,"Elastin is a key factor of tumor development in colorectal cancer Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the most common cancer and a leading cause of death worldwide. Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins regulate tumor growth and development in CRC. Elastin (ELN) is a component of ECM proteins involved in the tumor microenvironment. However, the role of ELN in CRC remains unclear. In this study, we analyzed ELN gene expression in tumors from CRC patients and adjacent non-tumor colon tissues and healthy controls from two existing microarray datasets. ELN protein was measured in human normal colon cells and colon cancer epithelial cells and tumor development was assessed in colon epithelial cells cultured in medium with or without ELN peptide on plates coated with ELN recombinant protein. Control plates were coated with PBS only. We found ELN gene expression was increased in tumors from CRC patients compared to adjacent non-tumor tissues and healthy controls. ELN protein was increased in cancer cells compared to normal colon epithelial cells. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) was a key cytokine to induce production of ECM proteins, but it did not induce ELN expression in colon cancer cells. Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) gene expression was increased, but that of MMP12 (elastase) did not change between CRC patients and control. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 3 (TIMP3) gene expression was decreased in colon tissues from CRC patients compared to healthy controls. However, MMP9, MMP12 and TIMP3 proteins were increased in colon cancer cells. ELN recombinant protein increased proliferation and wound healing in colon cancer epithelial cells. This had further increased in cancer cells incubated in plates coated with recombinant ELN coated plate and in culture media containing ELN peptide. A potential mechanism was that ELN induced epithelial mesenchymal transition with increased alpha-smooth muscle actin and vimentin proteins but decreased E-cadherin protein. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) mRNA was also increased in CRC patients compared to controls. ELN recombinant protein induced further increases in TNF protein in mouse bone marrow derived macrophages after lipopolysaccharide stimulation. These data suggest ELN regulates tumor development and the microenvironment in CRC."

The dysregulation of m6A has been linked to the initiation, progression, and metastasis of several cancer types, including colon cancer. The transcriptome of colon cancer indeed provides insight into dysregulated coding and non-coding RNAs, but it does not reveal the mechanisms, such as m6A modifications, that determine post-transcriptional and pre-translational regulations. This study using MeRIP sequencing aims to explain the distribution of m6A modification across altered gene expression and its association with colon cancer.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS AND RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The levels of m6A in different colon cancer cell lines were quantified and correlated with the expression of m6A modifiers such as writers, readers, and erasers.

We performed Epi-transcriptome profiling of m6A in colon cancer cell lines using Methylated RNA Immunoprecipitation (MeRIP) sequencing. The differential methylation analysis revealed 7312 m6A regions among the colon cancer cell lines. Our findings indicated that the m6A RNA methylation modifications were mainly distributed in the last exonic and 3' untranslated regions. We also discovered that non-coding RNAs such as miRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA carry m6A marks. Gene set enrichment and motif analysis suggested a strong association of m6A with post-transcriptional events, particularly splicing control.

No prior literature has examined if estrogen influences these differences. Methods: Using data from an incident population-based case (n = 1972) and control (n = 2386) study of colon cancer we evaluated if estrogen modifies the association between BMI and risk of colon cancer. Results: Women who were estrogen-negative (postmenopausal women not taking hormone replacement therapy, HRT) were at increased risk of colon cancer regardless of indicator of estrogen status used (i.e. estrogen-negative compared to estrogen-positive women defined as either being premenopausal or postmenopausal women using HRT, OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.23–1.93; no recent exposure to estrogens compared to current or HRT use within the past 2 years, OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.24–2.00; postmenopausal women not currently using HRT compared to postmenopausal women taking HRT, OR 1.65, 95% CI 1.29–2.12). BMI (kg/m2) was not associated with an increased risk of colon cancer among women who were estrogen-negative. However, women who were estrogen-positive experienced a greater than two-fold increase in colon cancer risk if they had a BMI of > 30 relative to those who had a BMI of <23 (for estrogen-positive, OR, 2.50, 95% CI 1.51–4.13; premenopausal, OR 2.19, 95% CI 0.94–5.07; postmenopausal using HRT, OR 3.36, 95% CI 1.58–7.13). Among men the colon cancer risk associated with BMI decreased with advancing age. Physical activity modified the increased colon cancer risk associated with a large BMI. Conclusions: These data suggest the importance of estrogen in colon cancer etiology. Being estrogen-negative resulted in a significant increased risk of colon cancer. However, BMI significantly increased the risk of colon cancer among women who were estrogen-positive. We hypothesize that estrogen up-regulates IGF-I receptors and IRS-I levels in the colon, which in turn increases susceptibility to obesity-induced increased levels of insulin. We further hypothesize that androgens may have similar effects in men given the decline in colon cancer risk associated with BMI with advancing age."
0,"Ceramide targets xIAP and cIAP1 to sensitize metastatic colon and breast cancer cells to apoptosis induction to suppress tumor progression Ceramide is a bioeffector that mediates various cellular processes, including apoptosis. However, the mechanism underlying ceramide function in apoptosis is apparently cell type-dependent and is not well-understood. We aimed at identifying molecular targets of ceramide in metastatic human colon and breast cancer cells, and determining the efficacy of ceramide analog in suppression of colon and breast cancer metastasis. The activity of and mechanism underlying ceramide as a cytotoxic agent, and as a sensitizer for Fas-mediated apoptosis was analyzed in human cell lines established from primary or metastatic colon and breast cancers. The efficacy of ceramide analog LCL85 in suppression of metastasis was examined in preclinical mouse tumor models. Exposure of human colon carcinoma cells to ceramide analog LCL85 results in apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Interestingly, a sublethal dose of LCL85 increased C16 ceramide content and overcame tumor cell resistance to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Subsequently, treatment of tumor cells with exogenous C16 ceramide resulted in increased tumor cell sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis. LCL85 resembles Smac mimetic BV6 in sensitization of colon carcinoma cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis by inducing proteasomal degradation of cIAP1 and xIAP proteins. LCL85 also decreased xIAP1 and cIAP1 protein levels and sensitized metastatic human breast cancer cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Silencing xIAP and cIAP1 with specific siRNAs significantly increased the metastatic human colon carcinoma cell sensitivity to Fas-mediated apoptosis, suggesting that IAP proteins mediate apoptosis resistance in metastatic human colon carcinoma cells and ceramide induces IAP protein degradation to sensitize the tumor cells to apoptosis induction. Consistent with its apoptosis sensitization activity, subtoxic doses of LCL85 suppressed colon carcinoma cell metastatic potential in an experimental lung metastasis mouse model, as well as breast cancer growth and spontaneous lung metastasis in an orthotopic breast cancer mouse model. We have identified xIAP and cIAP1 as molecular targets of ceramide and determined that ceramide analog LCL85 is an effective sensitizer in overcoming resistance of human cell lines established from metastatic colon and breast cancers to apoptosis induction to suppress metastasis in vivo."
0,"Left colon as a novel high-risk factor for postoperative recurrence of stage II colon cancer It is not clear whether stage II colon and rectal cancer have the same risk factors for recurrence. Thus, the purpose of this study was to identify the risk factors for postoperative recurrence in stage II colorectal cancer. We retrospectively analyzed the data of 990 patients who had undergone radical surgery for stage II colorectal cancer. Patients’ pathological features and characteristics including age, sex, family history, body mass index, tumor diameter, gross type of tumor, infiltration degree (T3/T4), tumor grade, perineural invasion, vascular invasion, lymphatic invasion, pathologic examination of lymph node number, and preoperative carcinoembryonic assay (CEA) level was compared between patients with and without recurrence. Finally, the prediction of the left and right colons was analyzed. The mean ages of the colon cancer and rectal cancer patients were 69.5 years and 66.4 years, respectively. In total, 508 (82.1%) and 285 (76.8%) patients were treated laparoscopically for colon cancer and rectal cancer, respectively, with median follow-up periods of 42.2 months and 41.8 months, respectively. Forty-four recurrences occurred in both the colon cancer (7.1%) and rectal cancer (11.9%) groups. The preoperative serum CEA level and T4 infiltration were significantly higher in recurrent colorectal cancer patients. The postoperative recurrence rate of left colon cancer (descending colon, sigmoid colon) was higher than that of right colon cancer (cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon) (OR 2.191, 95% CI 1.091–4.400, P = 0.027). In COX survival factor analysis of colon cancer, the left colon is one of the independent risk factors (risk ratio 5.377, 95% CI 0.216–0.88, P = 0.02). In disease-free survival (DFS), the left colon has a relatively poor prognosis (P = 0.05). However, in the COX analysis and prognosis analysis of OS, no difference was found between the left colon and the right colon. Preoperative CEA and depth of infiltration (T4) are high-risk factors associated with recurrence and are prognostic factors in stage II colorectal cancer. Left colon is also a risk factor for postoperative recurrence of stage II colon cancer."
0,"miR-378 suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells by inhibiting SDAD1. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the growth and metastasis of colon cancer. It is known that one set of miRNAs are dysregulated in colon cancer cells, but the mechanism of their role in cancer development is still largely unknown. Our study focuses on the role of miR-378 in colon cancer cells. Human colon cancer tissues and adjacent non-tumor tissues were collected from patients diagnosed in pathological examinations. In addition, human colon cancer cell lines LoVo, CaCo2, SW1116, SW480 and HCT-116, and a normal colonic mucosa cell line NCM460 were included. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to detect the miR-378 level in the clinical tissues and cell lines. In SW480 and HCT-116, miR-378 was artificially overexpressed or suppressed. Cell viability and proliferation were measured using MTT and colony formation assays, and apoptosis was detected via annexin V-PI staining and flow cytometry analysis. The transwell technique was applied to detect the migration and invasion of the colon cancer cells, and their epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) was evaluated by detecting EMT-associated markers using Western blotting. Bioinformatics methods were used to predict the potential targets of miR-378, and luciferase reporter assays were performed to conform the direct binding between miR-378 and its target mRNA. The activity of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway was evaluated by detecting the key factors through Western blotting. We found that miR-378 expression was low in colon cancer tissues and cell lines. Overexpression of miR-378 not only inhibits the proliferation of colon cancer cells in vitro by inducing apoptosis, but also inhibits migration and invasion by inhibiting the EMT of colon cancer cells. SDAD1 is a direct target gene of miR-378, and knockdown of SDAD1 suppresses the proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells. We also confirmed that miR-378 alleviated the malignant phenotypes of colon cancer cells by inhibiting the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. miR-378 inhibits the proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells by targeting SDAD1, defining miR-378 as a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of colon cancer."
0,"Are transverse colon cancers suitable for laparoscopic resection The large randomized trials reporting on laparoscopic versus open colon surgery for cancer have all excluded patients with transverse colon cancer lesions. This study was undertaken to review our experience with surgery for curable transverse colon cancer. A database of 938 laparoscopic colon resections performed between April 1991 and September 2004 was reviewed. Of 514 procedures for cancer, stage IV disease, mid to low rectal cancers, and total colectomies were excluded. On an intent-to-treat basis, outcomes of surgery for transverse colon lesions (TC) were compared with outcomes of segmental colon resections for other lesions (OC). A total of 22 TC were resected compared with 285 OC. Patients with TC were similar to patients with OC in age, gender, weight, and body mass index (BMI). Cancer stage was equivalent between patients with TC (9 Stage I, 7 Stage II, 6 Stage III) and OC (66 Stage I, 126 Stage II, 93 Stage III, p = 0.170) as was tumor size. Patients with TC underwent 9 transverse colectomies, 12 extended right hemicolectomies, and 1 extended left hemicolectomy. Patients with OC underwent 126 right hemicolectomies, 24 left hemicolectomies, and 135 sigmoid colectomies or anterior resections. There were no differences in conversion rate (18.2% vs. 13.3%, p = 0.752) or in intraoperative (9% vs. 8%, p = 0.814) or postoperative (41% vs. 30%, p = 0.418) complications. Operating time was longer with TC (209 ± 63 min vs. 176 ± 60 min, p = 0.042) and lymph node harvest was higher (15.3 ± 11.6 vs. 10.8 ± 7.6, p = 0.011). At a median followup of 17.2 months and 17.1 months, respectively, there were two (9%) recurrences after resection of TC and 17 (6%) recurrences after resection of OC. Laparoscopic resection of transverse colon cancers is technically feasible and not associated with a significantly higher rate of complications or conversions or with impaired oncologic outcomes compared with patients having segmental laparoscopic resections for other colon cancers. Operating time is longer."
0,"Mucins and mucin binding proteins in colorectal cancer. Mucins are high-molecular weight epithelial glycoproteins with a high content of clustered oligosaccharides O-glycosidically linked to tandem repeat peptides rich in threonine, serine, and proline. There are two structurally and functionally distinct classes of mucins: secreted gel-forming mucins (MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B, and MUC6) and transmembrane mucins (MUC1, MUC3A, MUC3B, MUC4, MUC12, MUC17), although the products of some MUC genes do not fit well into either class (MUC7, MUC8, MUC9, MUC13, MUC15, MUC16). MUC1 mucin, as detected immunologically, is increased in expression in colon cancers, which correlates with a worse prognosis. Expression of MUC2 secreted gel-forming mucin is generally decreased in colorectal adenocarcinoma, but preserved in mucinous carcinomas, a distinct subtype of colon cancer associated with microsatellite instability. Another secreted gel-forming mucin, MUC5AC, a product of normal gastric mucosa, is absent from normal colon, but frequently present in colorectal adenomas and colon cancers. The O-glycosidically linked oligosaccharides of mucins can be described in terms of core type, backbone type, and peripheral structures. Colon cancer mucins have differences in both core carbohydrates and in peripheral carbohydrate structures that are being investigated as diagnostic and prognostic markers, and also as targets for cancer vaccines. Colon cancer mucins typically have increases in three core structures: Tn antigen (GalNAcalphaThr/Ser), TF antigen (Galbeta3GalNAc) and sialyl Tn (NeuAcalpha6GalNAc). The type 3 core (GlcNAcbeta3Ga1NAc) predominant in normal colonic mucin is lacking in colon cancer mucins. There are cancer-associated alterations in the peripheral carbohydrates of colonic mucins including a decrease in O-acetyl-sialic acid and a decrease in sulfation. There are, however, cancer-associated increases in sialyl LeX and related structures on mucins and other glycoproteins that can serve as ligands for selectins, increasing the metastatic capacity of colon cancer cells. The endogenous galactoside-binding protein galectin-3, which is expressed at higher levels in colon cancers than normal colon, binds to colon cancer mucin as well as other glycoproteins. Interference of the binding of selectins and galectin-3 to mucin may show therapeutic or preventative promise for colon cancer."
0,"Biomarker correlation network in colorectal carcinoma by tumor anatomic location. Colorectal carcinoma evolves through a multitude of molecular events including somatic mutations, epigenetic alterations, and aberrant protein expression, influenced by host immune reactions. One way to interrogate the complex carcinogenic process and interactions between aberrant events is to model a biomarker correlation network. Such a network analysis integrates multidimensional tumor biomarker data to identify key molecular events and pathways that are central to an underlying biological process. Due to embryological, physiological, and microbial differences, proximal and distal colorectal cancers have distinct sets of molecular pathological signatures. Given these differences, we hypothesized that a biomarker correlation network might vary by tumor location. We performed network analyses of 54 biomarkers, including major mutational events, microsatellite instability (MSI), epigenetic features, protein expression status, and immune reactions using data from 1380 colorectal cancer cases: 690 cases with proximal colon cancer and 690 cases with distal colorectal cancer matched by age and sex. Edges were defined by statistically significant correlations between biomarkers using Spearman correlation analyses. We found that the proximal colon cancer network formed a denser network (total number of edges, n = 173) than the distal colorectal cancer network (n = 95) (P < 0.0001 in permutation tests). The value of the average clustering coefficient was 0.50 in the proximal colon cancer network and 0.30 in the distal colorectal cancer network, indicating the greater clustering tendency of the proximal colon cancer network. In particular, MSI was a key hub, highly connected with other biomarkers in proximal colon cancer, but not in distal colorectal cancer. Among patients with non-MSI-high cancer, BRAF mutation status emerged as a distinct marker with higher connectivity in the network of proximal colon cancer, but not in distal colorectal cancer. In proximal colon cancer, tumor biomarkers tended to be correlated with each other, and MSI and BRAF mutation functioned as key molecular characteristics during the carcinogenesis. Our findings highlight the importance of considering multiple correlated pathways for therapeutic targets especially in proximal colon cancer."
0,"Right and left-sided colon cancers - specificity of molecular mechanisms in tumorigenesis and progression Given the differences in embryonic origin, vascular and nervous supplies, microbiotic burden, and main physiological functions of left and right colons, tumor location is increasingly suggested to dictate tumor behavior affecting pathology, progression and prognosis. Right-sided colon cancers arise in the cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure and/or transverse colon, while left-sided colon cancers arise in the splenic flexure, descending, and/or sigmoid colon. In contrast to prior reports, we attempt to delineate programs of tumorigenesis independently for each side. Four hundred and eleven samples were extracted from The Cancer Genome Atlas-COAD cohort, based on a conservative sample inclusion criterion. Each side was independently analyzed with respect to their respective normal tissue, at the level of transcription, post-transcription, miRNA control and methylation in both a stage specific and stage-agnostic manner. Our results indicate a suppression of enzymes involved in various stages of carcinogen breakdown including CYP2C8, CYP4F12, GSTA1, and UGT1A within right colon tumors. This implies its reduced capacity to detoxify carcinogens, contributing to a genotoxic tumor environment, and subsequently a more aggressive phenotype. Additionally, we highlight a crucial nexus between calcium homeostasis (sensing, mobilization and absorption) and immune/GPCR signaling within left-sided tumors, possibly contributing to its reduced proliferative and metastatic potential. Interestingly, two genes SLC6A4 and HOXB13 show opposing regulatory trends within right and left tumors. Post-transcriptional regulation mediated by both RNA-binding proteins (e.g. NKRF (in left) and MSI2 (in right)) and miRNAs (e.g. miR-29a (in left); miR-155, miR181-d, miR-576 and miR23a (in right)) appear to exhibit side-specificity in control of their target transcripts and is pronounced in right colon tumors. Additionally, methylation results depict location-specific differences, with increased hypomethylation in open seas within left tumors, and increased hypermethylation of CpG islands within right tumors. Differences in molecular mechanisms captured here highlight distinctions in tumorigenesis and progression between left and right colon tumors, which will serve as the basis for future studies, influencing the efficacies of existing and future diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic interventions."
0,"Physical activity and risk of colorectal cancer in men and women We examined the association between self-reported occupational and recreational physical activity and the subsequent risk of colorectal cancer in a population-based cohort in Norway. During a mean follow-up time of 16.3 years for males and 15.5 years for females, 236 and 99 colon cancers and 170 and 58 rectal cancers were observed in males and females, respectively, among 53,242 males and 28,274 females who attended the screening between 1972 and 1978. Physical activity at a level equivalent to walking or bicycling for at least four hours a week during leisure-time was associated with decreased risk of colon cancer among females when compared with the sedentary group (RR = 0.62, 95% CI 0.40-0.97). Reduced risk of colon cancer was particularly marked in the proximal colon (RR = 0.51, 95% CI 0.28-0.93). This effect was not observed for occupational physical activity alone, probably due to a narrow range of self-reported physical activity at work among females. However, by combining occupational and recreational physical activity we observed an inverse dose-response effect as increasing total activity significantly reduced colon cancer risk (P for trend = 0.04). Among males 45 years or older at entry to the study, an inverse dose-response effect was observed between total physical activity and colon cancer risk (P for trend = 0.04). We also found in males a stronger preventive effect for physical activity in the proximal as compared to distal colon. In addition, we found a borderline significant decrease in colon cancer risk for occupational physical activity in males 45 years or older when compared to the sedentary group (RR = 0.74, 95% CI 0.53-1.04). All results were adjusted for age, body mass index, serum cholesterol and geographic region. No association between physical activity and rectal cancer was observed in males or females. The protective effect of physical activity on colon cancer risk is discussed in regard to energy balance, dietary factors, age, social class, body mass index and gastrointestinal transit time."
0,"NK-cell-dependent killing of colon carcinoma cells is mediated by natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) and stimulated by parvovirus infection of target cells Investigating how the immune system functions during malignancies is crucial to developing novel therapeutic strategies. Natural killer (NK) cells, an important component of the innate immune system, play a vital role in immune defense against tumors and virus-infected cells. The poor survival rate in colon cancer makes it particularly important to develop novel therapeutic strategies. Oncolytic viruses, in addition to lysing tumor cells, may have the potential to augment antitumor immune responses. In the present study, we investigate the role of NK cells and how parvovirus H-1PV can modulate NK-cell mediated immune responses against colon carcinoma. Human NK cells were isolated from the blood of healthy donors. The cytotoxicity and antibody-mediated inhibition of NK cells were measured in chromium release assays. Phenotypic assessment of colon cancer and dendritic cells was done by FACS. The statistical significance of the results was calculated with Student’s t test (*p <0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001). We show that IL-2-activated human NK cells can effectively kill colon carcinoma cells. Killing of colon carcinoma cells by NK cells was further enhanced upon infection of the former cells with parvovirus H-1PV. H-1PV has potent oncolytic activity against various tumors, yet its direct killing effect on colon carcinoma cells is limited. The cytotoxicity of NK cells towards colon carcinoma cells, both mock- and H-1PV-infected, was found to be mostly mediated by a combination of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs), namely NKp30, 44, and 46. Colon carcinoma cells displayed low to moderate expression of NK cell ligands, and this expression was modulated upon H-1PV infection. Lysates of H-1PV-infected colon carcinoma cells were found to increase MHC class II expression on dendritic cells. Altogether, these data suggest that IL-2-activated NK cells actively kill colon carcinoma cells and that this killing is mediated by several natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) in combination. Additionally, in association with parvovirus H-1PV, IL-2-activated NK cells have the potential to boost immune responses against colon cancer."
0,"N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) gene polymorphisms in colon and lung cancer patients N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) metabolizes arylamines and hydrazines moeities found in many therapeutic drugs, chemicals and carcinogens. The gene encoding NAT2 is polymorphic, thus resulting in rapid or slow acetylator phenotypes. The acetylator status may, therefore, predispose drug-induced toxicities and cancer risks, such as bladder, colon and lung cancer. Indeed, some studies demonstrate a positive association between NAT2 rapid acetylator phenotype and colon cancer, but results are inconsistent. The role of NAT2 acetylation status in lung cancer is likewise unclear, in which both the rapid and slow acetylator genotypes have been associated with disease. We investigated three genetic variations, c.481C>T, c.590G>A (p.R197Q) and c.857G>A (p.G286E), of the NAT2 gene, which are known to result in a slow acetylator phenotype. Using validated PCR-RFLP assays, we genotyped 243 healthy unrelated Caucasian control subjects, 92 colon and 67 lung cancer patients for these genetic variations. As there is a recent meta-analysis of NAT2 studies on colon cancer (unlike in lung cancer), we have also undertaken a systematic review of NAT2 studies on lung cancer, and we incorporated our results in a meta-analysis consisting of 16 studies, 3,865 lung cancer patients and 6,077 control subjects. We did not obtain statistically significant differences in NAT2 allele and genotype frequencies in colon cancer patients and control group. Certain genotypes, however, such as [c.590AA+c.857GA] and [c.590GA+c.857GA] were absent among the colon cancer patients. Similarly, allele frequencies in lung cancer patients and controls did not differ significantly. Nevertheless, there was a significant increase of genotypes [c.590GA] and [c.481CT+c.590GA], but absence of homozygous c.590AA and [c.590AA+c.857GA] in the lung cancer group. Meta-analysis of 16 NAT2 studies on lung cancer did not evidence an overall association of the rapid or slow acetylator status to lung cancer. Similarly, the summary odds ratios obtained with stratified meta-analysis based on ethnicity, and smoking status were not significant. Our study failed to show an overall association of NAT2 genotypes to either colon or lung cancer risk."
0,"Ovatodiolide suppresses colon tumorigenesis and prevents polarization of M2 tumor-associated macrophages through YAP oncogenic pathways An increased expression of Yes-associated protein (YAP1) has been shown to promote tumorigenesis in many cancer types including colon. However, the role of YAP1 in promoting colon tumorigenesis remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that YAP1 expression is associated with M2 tumor-associated macrophage polarization and the generation of colon cancer stem-like cells. YAP1 downregulation by gene silencing or a phytochemical, ovatodiolide, not only suppresses colon cancer tumorigenesis but also prevents M2 TAM polarization. Human monocytic cells, THP-1, and colon cancer cell lines, HCT116 and DLD-1, were co-cultured to mimic the interactions between tumor and its microenvironment. M2 polarization of the THP-1 cells were examined using both flow cytometry and q-PCR technique. The inhibition of YAP1 signaling was achieved by gene-silencing technique or ovatodiolide. The molecular consequences of YAP1 inhibition was demonstrated via colony formation, migration, and colon-sphere formation assays. 5-FU and ovatodiolide were used in drug combination studies. Xenograft and syngeneic mouse models were used to investigate the role of YAP1 in colon tumorigenesis and TAM generation. An increased YAP1 expression was found to be associated with a poor prognosis in patients with colon cancer using bioinformatics approach. We showed an increased YAP1 expression in the colon spheres, and colon cancer cells co-cultured with M2 TAMs. YAP1-silencing led to the concomitant decreased expression of major oncogenic pathways including Kras, mTOR, β-catenin, and M2-promoting IL-4 and tumor-promoting IL-6 cytokines. TAM co-cultured colon spheres showed a significantly higher tumor-initiating ability in vivo. Ovatodiolide treatment alone and in combination with 5-FU significantly suppressed in vivo tumorigenesis and less TAM infiltration in CT26 syngeneic mouse model. We have identified the dual function of YAP1 where its suppression not only inhibited tumorigenesis but also prevented the generation of cancer stem-like cells and M2 TAM polarization. Ovatodiolide treatment suppressed YAP1 oncogenic pathways to inhibit colon tumorigenesis and M2 TAM generation both in vitro and in vivo. Ovatodiolide should be considered for its potential for adjuvant therapeutic development."

0,"Partial purification of organ-specific neoantigens from human colon and breast cancer by affinity chromatography with human tumour-specific gamma-globulin. Organ-specific neoantigens (TA) shed from the tumours of patients with metastatic breast or colon cancer and which had filtered into the urine were partially purified by a combination of physicochemical methods and affinity chromatography. TA activity of the isolated materials was monitored by the blocking Tube LAI assay. Urinary protein was precipitated by 80% saturated ammonium sulphate. Albumin was removed by affinity chromatography with blue Sepharose CL-6B. Affinity columns of human IgG were prepared from sera of patients whose leucocytes were LAI+ to the breast- or colon-cancer extracts. The anti-breast-TA affinity column bound the TA in the urine of patients with metastatic breast cancer but not that of patients with metastatic colon cancer. The TA in urine of patients with metastatic colon cancer was bound by the anti-colon-TA affinity column. Analysis by SDS PAGE revealed that the isolates with and without TA activity were composed mostly of urinary protein which had bound nonspecifically to the human IgG affinity columns. With an affinity column of anti-NHS and Protein A, some of the contaminants were removed, to reveal SDD PAGE unique bands at about 38,000 and 12,000 mol. wt in the isolate with breast-TA activity. Rabbit antisera, raised to the material that had bound nonspecically to the anti-breast-TA affinity column, were used as an anti-nonspecific affinity column to remove the contaminants in the isolates from the affinity columns of anti-breast TA and anti-colon TA. After passage through the anti-nonspecific affinity column, the material that contained the putative breast or colon cancer TA revealed a unique band at about 38,000-40,000 mol. wt and residual fine bands at about 25,000-30,000 mol. wt. Both the control material and material with TA activity had similar bands at about 25,000 and 50,000 mol. wt. The specific activity of the putative colon or breast TAs, as measured by the blocking Tube LAI assay, was increased from about 30 to 5000-10,000 u/mg, a 125-400-fold enrichment."

0,"FABP4 promotes invasion and metastasis of colon cancer by regulating fatty acid transport The prognosis of colon cancer is poor for metastasis, while the mechanism, especially adipocytes related, is not yet clear. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), a transporter for lipids, on colon cancer progression. The distribution of lipids and FABP4 was tested in the colon cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues, and their relationship was also verified in vitro. Experiments about cellular invasion, migration and proliferation were performed to detect the impacts of FABP4 on the biological behaviors of colon cancer, and the positive results were checked in vivo. Meanwhile, the regulatory role of FABP4 in the energy and lipid metabolism was evaluated by the levels of triglyceride, ATP, LDH, glycerol and NEFA. At last, GO and KEGG analysis based on FABP4 overexpressed cells was performed, and the AKT pathway and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related proteins were determined by Western blot. Higher accumulation of lipids and stronger FABP4 transcription were observed in colon cancer tissues. Having been incubated with adipose tissue extract and overexpressed FABP4, colon cancer cells demonstrated enhanced lipid accumulation. In functional experiments, co-culture with adipose tissue extract significantly enhanced the invasion and migration of colon cancer cells, as well as the energy and lipid metabolism, and all these processes were reversed by FABP4 inhibitor. In addition, the metastasis of FABP4-overexpressed colon cancer cells was also significantly enhanced in vitro and in vivo. In terms of mechanism, the bioinformatics analysis showed that FABP4 was enriched in 11 pathways related to metabolic processes in FABP4 overexpressed cells. Finally, FABP4 overexpression improved EMT progression of colon cancer, as evidenced by the upregulation of Snail, MMP-2 and MMP-9, the downregulation of E-cadherin. The expression of p-Akt was also elevated. FABP4 overexpression could increase FAs transport to enhance energy and lipid metabolism, and activate AKT pathway and EMT to promote the migration and invasion of colon cancer cells."
0,"The effect of marital and insurance status on the survival of elderly patients with stage M1b colon cancer: a SEER-based study. Background Colon cancer is largely implicated in elderly patients (age ≥ 60 years). The prognosis of patients diagnosed with the M1b stage is vastly poor. Marital and insurance status has been considered important prognostic factors in various cancer types. However, how these factors influence elderly patients with stage M1b colon cancer remains to be explored. This study aims to uncover the role of marital and insurance status in the survival of elderly patients with stage M1b colon cancer. Methods We retrieved data for patients diagnosed with stage M1b colon cancer between 2010 and 2016 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Our analysis of the clinicopathological features, overall survival (OS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) was based on the marital and insurance status, respectively. Results In sum, 5709 stage M1b colon cancer patients with complete information from SEER were enrolled for analysis. The OS and CSS of the Non-married group were poorer compared to that of the Married group. The OS and CSS of the Uninsured group were poorer than both of the Insured group and Medicaid group. However, OS was comparable between Uninsured group and Medicaid groups. The findings allude that marital and insurance status potentially impact the long-term survival of elderly patients with M1b colon cancer. The subgroup survival analyses revealed the lowest risk for death among the Insured Married group based on the comparison of the OS and CSS across all other groups. Moreover, Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed race, marital status, surgery, and chemotherapy as independent predictors for OS, whereas insurance status, surgery,and chemotherapy were independent predictors for CSS in elderly patients with M1b colon cancer. Conclusion The marital and insurance status greatly impact the survival of elderly patients with M1b colon cancer. Therefore, it is imperative to provide more support to this vulnerable patient group who are lonely and uninsured, particularly in the psychological and health insurance aspect."
0,"Cracking the Code of Colorectal Cancer Screening: An Overview With a Focus on Current and Emerging Screening Methods. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a common cancer that affects the colon and rectum. It is a major cause of cancer-related mortality. A complicated interaction between environmental and genetic factors, such as age, diet, gut microbiota, obesity, chronic inflammation, and familial predisposition, appears to contribute to the pathophysiology of colorectal cancer. A multidisciplinary strategy is necessary for the effective care of CRC, including early detection through screening, surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted medicines. The slow progression of CRC through various stages gives us, physicians, leverage and a chance to promptly and adequately screen a patient and give them a better chance at life. There are multiple clinical trials being conducted to find better and the best screening and treatment modalities. Existing and emerging screening tests can be broadly divided into blood-based, stool-based and direct imaging-based screening tests. Colonoscopy is the gold standard. However, numerous emerging screening tests are changing the face of colon cancer screening. This review aims to highlight the background of CRC, including its etiopathogenesis, risk factors, and clinical features. It will also shed light on the existing and emerging screening techniques that will decide the future of this deadly cancer. In addition, the management section of this article will provide a summary of suggestions, including radiation and medical and surgical treatment modalities that may benefit physicians in managing this challenging condition. We conducted a comprehensive literature search in PubMed-indexed journals using the terms ""Colorectal Cancer,"" ""Etiopathogenesis of CRC,"" and ""Emerging screening and treatment modalities in CRC."" We explored the literature on the background of CRC, its pathogenesis, the importance of screening, screening modalities and comparisons amongst each one, and treatment options for this challenging cancer. We used peer-reviewed original research articles and systematic reviews published in English, conducted from 2015 to the present time, to reflect the developments in colorectal cancer. Studies with uncertain methodological details and outcomes were excluded."
0,"Is inguinal hernia associated with an increased risk of colon cancer? A systematic review and meta-analysis. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">The presence of an inguinal hernia has been associated with an increased risk of identifying colon cancer, and therefore colonoscopy is recommended prior to inguinal hernia repair. However, the evidence on the association between the presence of an inguinal hernia and colon cancer is conflicting and uncertain. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to synthesize all available evidence on this topic.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">A comprehensive search of PubMed and EMBASE was performed. Any comparative study (case-control or cohort study) comparing the rate of colon cancer detection in patients with and without inguinal hernias who underwent screening colonoscopy or flexible sigmoidoscopy was eligible for inclusion. Data were extracted and pooled under a random effects model.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The initial search identified 692 references, of which 4 comparative studies (1462 patients) met the inclusion criteria.

A standard surgical approach to these cancers has not been defined. The goal of this study was to compare lymph node harvest and post-operative morbidity between segmental resection and formal left hemicolectomy for splenic flexure colon cancers.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHOD"">Patients diagnosed with a splenic flexure cancer were identified from the 2012-2018 ACS-NSQIP colectomy-targeted database. Patients were categorized based on type of surgical resection - left hemicolectomy with colorectal anastomosis or segmental colectomy with colocolonic anastomosis. Demographic, clinicopathologic, and post-operative outcomes were compared between groups. Factors independently associated with lymph node harvest, operative time, and post-operative morbidity were investigated by linear and binomial logistic regression models.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 3,049 patients underwent colectomy for a splenic flexure cancer. Of these, 83.6% had a segmental colectomy and 73% were performed by a minimally invasive approach. T- and N-stage did not differ between segmental and left hemicolectomy groups (p = 0.703 and p = 0.429, respectively). Inadequate nodal harvest (&lt; 12 nodes) was infrequent and similar between the two procedures (7.4% vs. 9.1%, p = 0.13). Operative time was significantly shorter for segmental colectomy (213 ± 83.5 min vs. 193 ± 84.1 min, p &lt; 0.0001) and major morbidity was similar between the two surgical techniques (8.4% vs. 8.9%, p = 0.75). After accounting for demographic, clinicopathologic, and operative factors, binomial logistic regression showed that type of procedure was not significantly associated with LN harvest (OR 0.80, 95%CI 0.54-1.17) or major morbidity (OR 1.17, 95%CI 0.36-3.81). However, on linear regression, segmental splenic flexure resection was associated with shorter operative time (estimate 20.29, 95%CI 12.61-27.97, p &lt; 0.0001).</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Splenic flexure resection for colon cancer is associated with an adequate lymph node harvest.

0,"Prognostic value of hedgehog signaling pathway in patients with colon cancer Hedgehog signaling pathway plays an important role in normal mammalian gastrointestinal development and is implicated in the oncogenesis of various tumors. However, its correlation with progression and prognosis of colon cancer has not been well documented. This study was designed to investigate expression patterns of related proteins in hedgehog signaling pathway in colon cancer to elucidate its prognostic value in this tumor. Using human colon cancer and their corresponding non-diseased colon from 228 patients' biopsies, the expression of sonic hedgehog, its receptor Patched, and downstream transcription factor Gli1 was investigated by immunohistochemical staining to assess their association with the clinicopathological characteristics of colon cancer. Disease-free survival and overall survival were examined by Kaplan-Meier estimates and the log-rank test. Prognostic factors were determined by multivariate Cox analysis. One hundred and thirty-eight patients (59.6%) had sonic hedgehog-positive tumors and that the disease-free survival (43.5 vs. 73.3%, P < 0.001), and overall survival rates (50.7 vs. 88.9%, P < 0.001) of patients with sonic hedgehog-positive tumors were much lower than those of patients with sonic hedgehog-negative tumors. In addition, 163 patients (71.5%) had Patched-positive tumors, and the disease-free survival (41.7 vs. 76.9%, P < 0.001) and overall survival rates (55.2 vs. 80.0%, P = 0.002) of patients with Patched-positive tumors were also lower than those of patients with Patched-negative tumors. Moreover, positive Gli1 expression had a bad effect on the disease-free survival (41.9 vs. 73.2%, P < 0.001) and overall survival rate of patients with colon cancer (50.0 vs. 89.3%, P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, sonic hedgehog, Patched, and Gli1 status were indicators for poor disease-free survival and overall survival. These results have shown that the increasing expression of sonic hedgehog, Patched, and Gli1 are indicators for a poor prognosis in patients with colon cancer. This is the first report describing about the relationship between hedgehog signaling pathway and the prognosis of colon cancer."
0,"Pre-colectomy location and TNM staging of colon cancer by the computed tomography colonography: a diagnostic performance study The Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines 2018 and the recent update of that (version 2020) recommends accurate examination before major treatment for decision(s) in cases of colon cancer. Also, the difficulty in the identification of the lesion during colectomy may lead to resection of a wrong segment of the colon or a more extensive resection than planned. Accurate pre-colectomy local staging of colon cancer is required to make decisions for treatment of colon cancer. The objective of the study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the computed tomography colonography (CTC) for pre-colectomy tumor location and tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) staging of colon cancer. Data of preoperative colonoscopies, CTC, surgeries, and surgical pathology of a total of 269 patients diagnosed with colon cancer by colonoscopy and biopsy and underwent pre-colectomy location and TNM staging by CTC were collected and analyzed. The consistency between the radiological and the surgery/surgical-pathological for location and TN stages of colon tumor were estimated with the weighted kappa or kappa coefficient (κ) at 95% confidence interval (CI). CTC detected 261 (93%) and colonoscopy detected 201 (72%) correct locations of tumors. Sensitivity and accuracy of CTC for detection of location of colon tumors were 100% and 92.58% (κ = 0.89; 95% Cl: 0.83–0.95). 72.48% sensitivity, 90.64% specificity, and 83.57% accuracy were reported for CTC in differentiation of tumors confined to the colon wall (T1/T2) from advanced tumors (T3/T4) (κ = 0.69, 95% Cl: 0.51–0.75). 81.01% sensitivity, 89.11% specificity, and 83.93% accuracy of CTC was reported for differentiation of tumors between low–intermediate risk and high risk (κ = 0.68, 95% Cl: 0.53–0.75). 69.31% sensitivity, 66.15% specificity, and 67.14% accuracy of CTC were reported for N staging of tumors (κ = 0.41, 95% Cl: 0.59–0.69). CTC has high diagnostic parameters for pre-colectomy location and T staging of colon tumors except patients of colon cancer who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. III. 2."
0,"A cross-sectional study on the association between physical activity and the risk of colon cancer based on NHANES 2007-2018. Colon cancer poses a significant threat to global health, and studies have shown a correlation between physical activity (PA) and the incidence of colon cancer. However, existing research has not quantitatively analyzed PA to evaluate its impact on the risk of colon cancer comprehensively. Data related to the study were obtained from the NHANES database for participants aged 20 and above between 2007 and 2018. Calculate the daily total metabolic equivalent (MET) based on the duration of different physical activities for each participant, use multivariate logistic regression analysis to evaluate the association between PA and colon cancer risk, perform subgroup analysis to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between different subgroups, and use RCS regression analysis to evaluate the non-linear relationship between MET and colon cancer risk. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that compared with the overall data of the participants in this study, the OR of the low PA group (PA ≤ 120MET/day) was 1.224 (95% CI 1.031-1.453, P = 0.023), the OR of the mild PA group (120 < PA ≤ 600MET/day) was 1.026 (95%CI 0.707-1.488, P = 0.894), the OR of the moderate intensity PA group (600 < PA ≤ 1200MET/day) was 0.798 (95% CI 0.506-1.258, P = 0.334), and the OR of the high-intensity PA group (PA > 1200MET/day) was 0.470 (95% CI 0.249-0.885, P = 0.022), these results are consistent in subgroup analysis. The RCS regression analysis results showed a significant nonlinear relationship between MET and the risk of colon cancer(p < 0.001), with an inflection point observed at 1879 MET/day on the correlation curve. Low physical activity increases the risk of colon cancer, while moderate to high-intensity physical activity can reduce the risk of colon cancer. The results of this study emphasize the importance of maintaining appropriate physical activity as a healthy way to prevent colon cancer."
0,"Metastatic colon cancer of the small intestine diagnosed using genetic analysis: a case report Intestinal-type adenocarcinoma is widely detected in the gastrointestinal tract, head and neck, lower respiratory and urinary systems. Determining the nature (monoclonal or multicentric) of the intestinal adenocarcinoma is sometimes a diagnostic challenge owing to its occurrence at various locations of the body, especially in the lower gastrointestinal tract. Herein, we successfully diagnosed metastatic colon cancer in the small intestine using tumor protein 53 gene (TP53) mutation analysis. An 83-year-old woman presented with severe abdominal pain and nausea at the emergency department of the hospital. Her history included surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy for colon and breast cancers. Abdominal computed tomography revealed small intestinal dilation, which was associated with the mural nodule detected on fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. Laparoscopy-assisted small bowel resection was performed based on the diagnosis of small bowel obstruction, probably due to recurrence of the colon or breast cancer. Macroscopically, an ulcerated tumor was present in the resected small intestine. Histologically, the cancer cells showed infiltrative growth of colonic dysplastic glands, whose non-specific finding made it difficult to determine the relationship with past colon cancers. Retrospective pathological examination confirmed that the previous breast and colon carcinomas were primary cancers. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the small intestinal and colon cancer cells showed diffuse positive tumor protein 53 (p53) expression. However, the breast cancer cells showed only weakly positive p53 expression. In addition, TP53 mutational analysis detected an identical missense mutation (p.T211I) between the two intestinal cancers. Moreover, further molecular genetic work-up revealed that both small intestinal and colon adenocarcinomas harbored an identical missense mutation (p.G12D) of KRAS gene. In conclusion, the small intestinal cancer in this case was identified as a metastatic adenocarcinoma arising from a past colon cancer. Genetic analyses help in clarifying the identity of the cells in multiple cancer cases. In morphologically indeterminate cases, molecular analysis of common cancer-related genes can be useful for a precise and reproducible diagnosis."

The aim of the study was to investigate the connection between E. coli and Fpr2 in the recovery of colon epithelial cells.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The deficiency of Fpr2 was associated with impaired integrity of the colon mucosa and an imbalance of microbiota, characterized by the enrichment of Proteobacteria in the colon. Two serotypes of E. coli, O22:H8 and O91:H21, were identified in the mouse colon through complete genome sequencing. E. coli O22:H8 was found to be prevalent in the gut of mice and exhibited lower virulence compared to O91:H21. Germ-free (GF) mice that were pre-orally inoculated with E. coli O22:H8 showed reduced susceptibility to chemically induced colitis, increased proliferation of epithelial cells, and improved mouse survival. Following infection with E. coli O22:H8, the expression of Fpr2 in colon epithelial cells was upregulated, and the products derived from E. coli O22:H8 induced migration and proliferation of colon epithelial cells through Fpr2. Fpr2 deficiency increased susceptibility to chemically induced colitis, delayed the repair of damaged colon epithelial cells, and heightened inflammatory responses. Additionally, the population of E. coli was observed to increase in the colons of Fpr2<sup>-/-</sup> mice with colitis.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Commensal E. coli O22:H8 stimulated the upregulation of Fpr2 expression in colon epithelial cells, and the products from E. coli induced migration and proliferation of colon epithelial cells through Fpr2.

0,"STI571 reduces TRAIL-induced apoptosis in colon cancer cells: c-Abl activation by the death receptor leads to stress kinase-dependent cell death In an effort to achieve better cancer therapies, we elucidated the combination cancer therapy of STI571 (an inhibitor of Bcr-Abl and clinically used for chronic myelogenous leukemia) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL, a developing antitumor agent) in leukemia, colon, and prostate cancer cells. Colon cancer (HCT116, SW480), prostate cancer (PC3, LNCaP) and leukemia (K562) cells were treated with STI571 and TRAIL. Cell viability was determined by MTT assay and sub-G1 appearance. Protein expression and kinase phosphorylation were determined by Western blotting. c-Abl and p73 activities were inhibited by target-specific small interfering (si)RNA. In vitro kinase assay of c-Abl was conducted using CRK as a substrate. We found that STI571 exerts opposite effects on the antitumor activity of TRAIL. It enhanced cytotoxicity in TRAIL-treated K562 leukemia cells and reduced TRAIL-induced apoptosis in HCT116 and SW480 colon cancer cells, while having no effect on PC3 and LNCaP cells. In colon and prostate cancer cells, TRAIL caused c-Abl cleavage to the active form via a caspase pathway. Interestingly, JNK and p38 MAPK inhibitors effectively blocked TRAIL-induced toxicity in the colon, but not in prostate cancer cells. Next, we found that STI571 could attenuate TRAIL-induced c-Abl, JNK and p38 activation in HCT116 cells. In addition, siRNA targeting knockdown of c-Abl and p73 also reduced TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity, rendering HCT116 cells less responsive to stress kinase activation, and masking the cytoprotective effect of STI571. All together we demonstrate a novel mediator role of p73 in activating the stress kinases p38 and JNK in the classical apoptotic pathway of TRAIL. TRAIL via caspase-dependent action can sequentially activate c-Abl, p73, and stress kinases, which contribute to apoptosis in colon cancer cells. Through the inhibition of c-Abl-mediated apoptotic p73 signaling, STI571 reduces the antitumor activity of TRAIL in colon cancer cells. Our results raise additional concerns when developing combination cancer therapy with TRAIL and STI571 in the future."

0,"Integrated multi-omics unveils novel immune signature for predicting prognosis in colon cancer patients. Colon cancer, a prevalent malignancy, is subject to intricate immune modulation, which substantially affects both treatment efficacy and prognostic outcomes. Furthermore, colon cancer is highly heterogeneous, and our comprehensive understanding of its immune microenvironment has not yet been fully realized. There is still ample opportunity for in-depth investigation into the composition and interactions of immune cells within colon cancer, as well as their implications for disease prognosis. In this study, we employed single-cell data from colon cancer to distinguish immune cells from non-immune cells through cluster analysis. Furthermore, we conducted an in-depth analysis of myeloid and T cells, which were categorized into 20 distinct cell subpopulations. Functional enrichment analysis revealed T cells' active involvement in the Fatty Acid Metabolism and Adipogenesis pathways, while immune checkpoint-associated genes (ICGs) were notably upregulated in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Subsequent analysis involved calculating gene scores to characterize cell subpopulations, which, when combined with patient survival time analysis, revealed a significant association between the gene characterization score (referred to as ""imm-score"") and the survival of colon cancer patients. Specifically, the presence of CD8<sup>+</sup>-ANXA1<sup>hi</sup>-T cells was linked to shortened overall survival in the high imm-score subgroup. Subsequently, combined with genomic analysis, patients in the high imm-score subgroup exhibited elevated tumor mutation burden (TMB) and heightened activity in both the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and Notch signaling pathway. Finally, according to our new algorithm, scores calculated predicted the effectiveness of immunotherapy for patients. The results revealed that patients with lower scores could achieve better therapeutic outcomes with immunotherapy. This study offers an extensive analysis of the interplay between T cells and myeloid cells within colon cancer tissues, exploring their impact on the survival and prognosis of colon cancer patients. Additionally, it unveils the potential significance of the imm-score in colon cancer, potentially indicating a poor prognosis and providing novel insights into the immune-regulatory mechanisms underlying the disease."
0,"An Enhancement of Computer Aided Approach for Colon Cancer Detection in WCE Images Using ROI Based Color Histogram and SVM2. The colon cancer is formed by uncontrollable growth of abnormal cells in large intestine or colon that can affect both men and women and it is third cancer disease in the world. At present, Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) screening method is utilized to identify colon cancer tumor at early stage to save the patient life who affected by the colon cancer. In this CTC method, the radiologist needs to analyze the colon polyps in digital image using computer aided approach with accurate automatic tumor classification to detect the cancer tumor at early stage. This kind of computer aided approach can operate as an intermediate between input digital image and radiologist. Therefore, in this paper, a novel computer aided approach is presented with ROI based color histogram and SVM2 to find the cancer tumor in WCE image. In this method, the digital WCE image can be preprocessed using filtering and ROI based color histogram depending on the salient region in colon. In common, the salient region can be distinctive because of low redundancy. Hence, the saliency is estimated by ROI based color histogram on the basis of color and structure contrast in given colon image for the further process of clustering and tumor classification in WCE image. The K-means clustering can be employed to cluster the preprocessed digital image to discover the tumor of colon. Subsequently, the features are extracted from the image in terms of contrast, correlation, energy and homogeneity by applying SGLDM method. The SVM2 classifier as input to classify the tumor is normal or malignancy using selected feature vectors. Here, the extracted features can also being combined to enhance the hybrid feature vector for the accurate tumor classification. Experimental results of proposed method can show that this presented technique can executes can tumor detection in colon image accurately reaching almost 95% in evaluation with existing algorithms."
0,"Laparoscopic colectomy for transverse colon carcinoma. Laparoscopic resection of transverse colon carcinoma is technically demanding and was excluded from most of the large trials of laparoscopic colectomy. The aim of this study was to assess the safety, feasibility, and outcome of laparoscopic resection of carcinoma of the transverse colon. A retrospective review was performed to identify patients who underwent laparoscopic resection of transverse colon carcinoma. These patients were compared to patients who had laparoscopic resection for right and sigmoid colon carcinoma. In addition, they were compared to a historical series of patients who underwent open resection for transverse colon cancer. A total of 22 patients underwent laparoscopic resection for transverse colon carcinoma. Sixty-eight patients operated for right colon cancer and 64 operated for sigmoid colon cancer served as comparison groups. Twenty-four patients were identified for the historical open group. Intraoperative complications occurred in 4.5% of patients with transverse colon cancer compared to 5.9% (P = 1.0) and 7.8% (P = 1.0) of patients with right and sigmoid colon cancer, respectively. The early postoperative complication rate was 45, 50 (P = 1.0), and 37.5% (P = 0.22) in the three groups, respectively. Conversion was required in 1 (5%) patient in the laparoscopic transverse colon group. The conversion rate and late complications were not significantly different in the three groups. There was no significant difference in the number of lymph nodes harvested in the laparoscopic and open groups. Operative time was significantly longer in the laparoscopic transverse colectomy group when compared to all other groups (P = 0.001, 0.008, and <0.001 compared to right, sigmoid, and open transverse colectomy, respectively). The results of laparoscopic colon resection for transverse colon carcinoma are comparable to the results of laparoscopic resection of right or sigmoid colon cancer and open resection of transverse colon carcinoma. These results suggest that laparoscopic resection of transverse colon carcinoma is safe and feasible."

Patients presenting to Ninewells Hospital between July 2007 and August 2010, with adenocarcinoma of the colon and rectum with synchronous liver metastases were considered. Patients underwent simultaneous laparoscopic liver and colon cancer resection, a staged laparoscopic resection of SCRLM and colon cancer, or simultaneous colon resection and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of SCRLM. Primary endpoints were in-hospital morbidity and mortality, total hospital stay, intraoperative blood loss, duration of surgery, and resection margin status. Twenty-eight patients presented with synchronous colorectal liver metastases. Thirteen patients underwent a simultaneous laparoscopic liver and colon resection (median operating time, 370 (range, 190–540) min; median hospital stay, 7 (range, 3–54) days), seven patients had a staged laparoscopic resection of SCRLM and primary colon cancer (median operating time, 530 (range, 360–980) min; median hospital stay 14, (range, 6–51) days), and eight patients underwent laparoscopic colon resection and RFA of SCRLM (median operating time, 310 (range, 240–425) min; median hospital stay, 8 (range, 6–13) days). There were no conversions to an open procedure. Overall in-hospital morbidity and mortality was 28 and 0 % respectively. An R0 resection margin was achieved in 91 % of the resection group. At a median follow-up of 26 (range, 18–55) months, 19 (90 %) patients remain disease-free. Totally laparoscopic strategies for the radical treatment of stage IV colorectal cancer are feasible with low morbidity and favorable outcomes. A laparoscopic approach for the simultaneous management of SCRLM and primary colon cancer is associated with reduced surgical access trauma, postoperative morbidity, and hospital stay with no compromise in short-term oncological outcome."
0,"ZIC5, a survival biomarker, facilitates tumor progression and stemness in colon cancer via the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway. Colorectal cancer (CRC), a highly heterogeneous disease, is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths. Mounting evidence has indicated that the zinc finger of the cerebellum 5 (ZIC5) is involved in the pathological processes of cancer. At present, there are few and conflicting studies on ZIC5 in CRC. The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical value, function and molecular mechanism of ZIC5 in colon cancer. ZIC5 expression analysis in pan-cancer was performed using the TCGA database. The correlation of ZIC5 expression with clinicopathologic parameters of colon cancer was assessed in public and external datasets, respectively. The influence of ZIC5 expression on survival was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve and Cox regression models. In addition, a series of in vitro experiments on cell proliferation, invasion, migration and stemness were performed to further explore the function and potential mechanisms of ZIC5 in colon cancer. ZIC5 mRNA expression is significantly elevated in the vast majority of cancers. We found that ZIC5 is elevated in colon cancer tissues, and high ZIC5 expression was associated with poorer survival of colon cancer patients. ZIC5 expression was positively correlated with the malignant pathological phenotype, and it's an independent risk marker for the overall survival (OS) of colon cancer patients. We demonstrated that ZIC5 promoted proliferation, invasion, migration and EMT of colon cancer cells. Additionally, ZIC5 enhances colon cancer stem cell (CSC) properties. Mechanistically, ZIC5 functions in colon cancer cells by upregulating Wnt signaling. ZIC5 could enhance Wnt/β-catenin signaling by interacting with β-catenin. Interestingly, in HCT116 cells, ZIC5 doesn't affect the protein level of β-catenin and its nuclear translocation likely due to the deletion mutation of β-catenin at Ser45. We identified ZIC5 as a survival marker for colon cancer patients. Our study shows that inhibition of ZIC5 might be a potential therapeutic strategy for colon cancer."
0,"Genomic instability and colon cancer. Colorectal cancer affected ∼135,000 people in the United States in 2001, resulting in 57,000 deaths. At the cellular level, colorectal cancer results from the progressive accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations that lead to the transformation of normal colonic epithelial cells to colon adenocarcinoma cells. The loss of genomic stability appears to be a key molecular and pathogenetic step that occurs early in the tumorigenesis process and serves to create a permissive environment for the occurrence of alterations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes. At least three forms of genomic instability have been identified in colon cancer: (1) microsatellite instability (MSI), (2) chromosome instability (i.e. aneusomy, gains and losses of chromosomal regions) (CIN), and (3) chromosomal translocations. Microsatellite instability occurs in ∼15% of colon cancers and results from inactivation of the mutation mismatch repair (MMR) system by either MMR gene mutations or hypermethylation of the MLH1 promoter. MSI promotes tumorigenesis through generating mutations in target genes that possess coding microsatellite repeats, such as TGFBR2 and BAX. CIN is found in the majority of colon cancers and leads to a different pattern of gene alterations that contribute to tumor formation. CIN appears to result primarily from deregulation of the DNA replication checkpoints and mitotic-spindle checkpoints. The mechanisms that induce and influence genomic instability in cancer in general and more specifically in colon cancer are only partly understood and are consequently under intense investigation. These studies have revealed mutation of the mitotic checkpoint regulators BUB1 and BUBR1 and amplification of STK15 in a subset of CIN colon cancers. The etiology of CIN in the other unexplained cases of colon cancer remains to be determined. Hopefully, discovery of the cause and specific role of genomic instability in colon cancer will yield more effective chemotherapy strategies that take advantage of this unique characteristic of cancer cells."

Mechanistic studies explored the interaction between PVT1 and ATAD3A, and the role of TLR4/NF-κB pathway in regulating PVT1 expression.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">qPCR experiments showed that Fn abundance was associated with later clinical stage and shorter RFS. Clone formation, EdU proliferation assay and apoptosis assay showed that Fn could change the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to oxaliplatin. Further RNA sequencing showed that Fn infection could upregulate the expression of long noncoding RNA plasmacytoma variant translocation 1 (PVT1) in colon cancer cells. The abundance of Fn in colon cancer tissues was positively correlated with the level of PVT1, and the mechanism was that PVT1 binds to AAA domain protein 3 (ATAD3A) and prevents its ubiquitination. Fn upregulates ATAD3A expression through PVT1 and inhibits ER stress-mediated cell death. In addition, in colon cancer cells co-cultured with Fn, PVT1 expression is regulated by the TLR4/NF-κB pathway.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">This study delineates a pathway where Fn infection promotes oxaliplatin resistancein colon cancer cells by upregulating PVT1 via the TLR4/NF-κB pathway.

0,"Early onset MSI-H colon cancer with MLH1 promoter methylation, is there a genetic predisposition? To investigate the etiology of MLH1 promoter methylation in mismatch repair (MMR) mutation-negative early onset MSI-H colon cancer. As this type of colon cancer is associated with high ages, young patients bearing this type of malignancy are rare and could provide additional insight into the etiology of sporadic MSI-H colon cancer. We studied a set of 46 MSI-H colon tumors cases with MLH1 promoter methylation which was enriched for patients with an age of onset below 50 years (n = 13). Tumors were tested for CIMP marker methylation and mutations linked to methylation: BRAF, KRAS, GADD45A and the MLH1 -93G>A polymorphism. When available, normal colon and leukocyte DNA was tested for GADD45A mutations and germline MLH1 methylation. SNP array analysis was performed on a subset of tumors. We identified two cases (33 and 60 years) with MLH1 germline promoter methylation. BRAF mutations were less frequent in colon cancer patients below 50 years relative to patients above 50 years (p-value: 0.044). CIMP-high was infrequent and related to BRAF mutations in patients below 50 years. In comparison with published controls the G>A polymorphism was associated with our cohort. Although similar distribution of the pathogenic A allele was observed in the patients with an age of onset above and below 50 years, the significance for the association was lost for the group under 50 years. GADD45A sequencing yielded an unclassified variant. Tumors from both age groups showed infrequent copy number changes and loss-of-heterozygosity. Somatic or germline GADD45A mutations did not explain sporadic MSI-H colon cancer. Although germline MLH1 methylation was found in two individuals, locus-specific somatic MLH1 hypermethylation explained the majority of sporadic early onset MSI-H colon cancer cases. Our data do not suggest an intrinsic tendency for CpG island hypermethylation in these early onset MSI-H tumors other than through somatic mutation of BRAF."

0,"A weight-of-evidence review of colorectal cancer in pesticide applicators: the agricultural health study and other epidemiologic studies To systematically evaluate epidemiologic studies on pesticides and colon cancer and rectal cancer in agricultural pesticide applicator populations using a transparent “weight-of-evidence” (WOE) methodological approach. Twenty-nine (29) publications from the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) and 13 additional epidemiologic studies were identified that reported data for pesticide applicators and/or specific pesticide compounds and colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer. The AHS evaluated pesticide applicators as well as dose–response associations for specific pesticide compounds, whereas the large majority of non-AHS evaluated applicators but did not analyze specific compounds or dose–response trends. This WOE assessment of 153 different pesticide–outcome pairs emphasized several key evidentiary features: existence of statistically significant relative risks, magnitude of observed associations, results from the most reliable exposure assessments, and evidence of convincing dose–response relationships (i.e., those monotonically increasing, with statistically significant trend tests). Occupation as a pesticide applicator or pesticide application as a farming-related function was not associated with increasing the risk of colon or rectal cancer. Deficits of colon or rectal cancer were observed across most studies of pesticide applicators. After applying the WOE methodology to the epidemiologic studies of specific pesticide compounds and colon or rectal cancer, a number of pesticide–outcome pairs were identified and evaluated further based on positive statistical associations. Of these, only two—aldicarb and colon cancer and imazethapyr and proximal colon cancer—appears to warrant further discussion regarding a possible causal relationship, although the epidemiologic data are limited. For the remainder, a lack of a clear dose–response trend, inconsistencies in associations between exposure metrics and comparison groups, imprecise associations, variable participation rates for analyses of specific compounds, and the reliance upon data from one study (the AHS) limit interpretation regarding risk. The available epidemiologic evidence does not support a causal relationship between occupation as a pesticide applicator or specific pesticide exposures and colon or rectal cancer."
0,"Safety and effectiveness of high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery for cancer of the descending colon under indocyanine green fluorescence imaging: a pilot study Complete mesocolic excision with central vascular ligation is a standard advanced technique for achieving favorable long-term oncological outcomes in colon cancer surgery. Clinical evidence abounds demonstrating the safety of high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) for sigmoid colon cancer but is scarce for descending colon cancer. A major concern is the blood supply to the remnant distal sigmoid colon, especially for cases with a long sigmoid colon. We sought to clarify the safety and feasibility of high ligation of the IMA in surgery for descending colon cancer using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging. In this prospective single-center pilot study, we examined 20 patients with descending colon cancer who underwent laparoscopic colectomy between April 2018 and September 2019. Following full mobilization and division of the proximal colonic mesentery, we temporarily clamped the root of the IMA and performed ICG fluorescence imaging of the blood flow to the sigmoid colon. The postoperative anastomosis-related complications (primary endpoint) and length of viable remnant colon, and the number of lymph nodes retrieved (secondary endpoints) were evaluated and compared with historical controls who underwent conventional IMA-preserving surgery (n = 20). Blood flow reached 40 (17–66) cm retrograde from the peritoneal reflection, even after IMA clamping. Accordingly, IMA high ligation was performed in all cases. No anastomotic anastomosis-related complications occurred in each group. Retrieved total lymph nodes were higher in number in the ICG-guided group than in the conventional group (p = 0.035). Specifically, more principal nodes were retrieved in the ICG-guided group, compared with the conventional group (p = 0.023). However, the distal margin was not as long compared with the conventional group. We demonstrated the safety and feasibility of high ligation of the IMA for descending colon cancer without sacrificing additional distal colon using fluorescence evaluation of blood flow in the remnant colon."

0,"Association between red and processed meat consumption and colorectal cancer risk: a comprehensive meta-analysis of prospective studies. Increasing evidence suggests that red and processed meat consumption may elevate the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), yet the magnitude and consistency of this association remain debated. This meta-analysis aims to quantify the relationship between red and processed meat intake and the risk of CRC, colon cancer, and rectal cancer using the most comprehensive set of prospective studies to date. We conducted a comprehensive search in PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Google Scholar databases from 1990 to November 2024, to identify relevant prospective studies examining red, processed, and total meat consumption in relation to colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer risk. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were extracted for each study and pooled using a random-effects model to account for variability among studies. Statistical evaluation was executed using the online platform MetaAnalysisOnline.com. A total of 60 prospective studies were included. Red meat consumption was associated with a significantly increased risk of colon cancer (HR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.15-1.30), colorectal cancer (HR = 1.15, 95% CI 1.10-1.21), and rectal cancer (HR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.07-1.39). Processed meat consumption showed similar associations with increased risk for colon cancer (HR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.07-1.20), colorectal cancer (HR = 1.21, 95% CI 1.14-1.28), and rectal cancer (HR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.05-1.30). Total meat consumption also correlated with an elevated risk of colon cancer (HR = 1.22, 95% CI 1.11-1.35), colorectal cancer (HR = 1.17, 95% CI 1.12-1.22), and rectal cancer (HR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.10-1.48). This meta-analysis provides robust evidence that high consumption of red and processed meats is significantly associated with an increased risk of colorectal, colon, and rectal cancers. These findings reinforce current dietary recommendations advocating for the limitation of red and processed meat intake as part of cancer prevention strategies."
0,"Wnt3a expression is associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition and promotes colon cancer progression Epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) contributes to the progression and metastasis of cancer cells and is associated with a more invasive phenotype of cancer. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway is one of the major pathways involved in EMT regulation. Many studies provide evidence that β-catenin, the key regulator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, is important in regulating EMT in cancer. However, the roles of Wnt3a, the representative canonical Wnt ligand, in EMT and colon cancer progression have not yet been fully explored. The expression levels of Wnt3a and EMT-associated proteins (E-cadherin, vimentin, and β-catenin) were assessed by immunohistochemistry in human colon cancer tissues to evaluate the clinicopathological significance of Wnt3a, as well as the correlation between Wnt3a and EMT. We then upregulated Wnt3a expression in HCT116 colon cancer cells, established a nude mouse xenograft model, detected the expression of EMT and Wnt/β-catenin signaling-associated proteins, and observed invasion and clone-initiating abilities. In 203 human colon cancer tissue samples, Wnt3a protein overexpression was related to colon cancer histological differentiation (P = 0.004), clinical stage (P = 0.008), presence of metastasis and recurrence (P = 0.036), and survival time (P = 0.007) of colon cancer patients. Wnt3a expression was notably concomitant with EMT immunohistochemical features, such as reduced expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin (P = 0.012), increased expression of the mesenchymal marker vimentin (P = 0.002), and cytoplasmic distribution of β-catenin (P = 0.021). Results of in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that Wnt3a overexpression could alter cell morphology, regulate EMT-associated protein expression, and enhance clone-initiation and invasion. Dkk1 (antagonist of Wnt/β-catenin signaling) could also partially reverse the expression of EMT-associated proteins in Wnt3a-overexpressing cells. Wnt3a expression was associated with EMT and promoted colon cancer progression. The EMT-inducing effect was partially due to the stimulative effect of Wnt3a on the Wnt/β-catenin pathway."

0,"Better survival in right-sided versus left-sided stage I - III colon cancer patients The distinction between right-sided and left-sided colon cancer has recently received considerable attention due to differences regarding underlying genetic mutations. There is an ongoing debate if right- versus left-sided tumor location itself represents an independent prognostic factor. We aimed to investigate this question by using propensity score matching. Patients with resected, stage I - III colon cancer were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (2004–2012). Both univariable and multivariable Cox regression as well as propensity score matching were used. Overall, 91,416 patients (51,937 [56.8 %] with right-sided, 39,479 [43.2 %] with left-sided colon cancer; median follow-up 38 months) were eligible. In univariable analysis, patients with right-sided cancer had worse overall (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.32, 95 % CI:1.29–1.36, P < 0.001) and cancer-specific survival (HR = 1.26, 95 % CI:1.21–1.30, P < 0.001) compared to patients with left-sided cancer. After propensity score matching, the prognosis of right-sided carcinomas was better regarding overall (HR = 0.92, 95 % CI: 0.89 − 0.94, P < 0.001) and cancer-specific survival (HR = 0.90, 95 % CI:0.87 − 0.93, P < 0.001). In stage I and II, the prognosis of right-sided cancer was better for overall (HR = 0.89, 95 % CI:0.84–0.94 and HR = 0.85, 95 % CI:0.81–0.89) and cancer-specific survival (HR = 0.71, 95 % CI:0.64 − 0.79 and HR = 0.75, 95 % CI:0.70–0.80). Right- and left-sided colon cancer had a similar prognosis for stage III (overall: HR = 0.99, 95 % CI:0.95–1.03 and cancer-specific: HR = 1.04, 95 % CI:0.99–1.09). This population-based analysis on stage I - III colon cancer provides evidence that the prognosis of localized right-sided colon cancer is better compared to left-sided colon cancer. This questions the paradigm from previous research claiming a worse survival in right-sided colon cancer patients."
0,"Minimally invasive surgery for colorectal cancer with persistent descending mesocolon: radiological findings and short-term outcomes Persistent descending mesocolon (PDM) is typically asymptomatic. However, features such as adhesion and variations in vessel anatomy could affect the surgical techniques for colorectal cancer (CRC). This study aimed to investigate the frequency and radiological features of PDM. Short-term outcomes after conventional laparoscopic surgery (CLS) for CRC with PDM were also investigated to assess the feasibility of CLS and identify strategies for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in CRC with PDM. Patients who underwent MIS, including CLS and robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS), for left-sided CRC between April 2016 and June 2019, were investigated. PDM was defined as the existence of the right border of the descending colon inside the right border of the left kidney based on preoperative computed tomography findings. Radiological findings of 837 patients were examined, and PDM was found in 19 (2.3%) patients. Radiality of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) was found in 5 of 19 (26.3%) PDM cases, which was significantly higher than that in non-PDM cases. The median lengths between the IMA and inferior mesenteric vein (IMV) and between the IMV and descending colon in PDM cases were 14.8 mm and 17.2 mm, respectively, which were significantly shorter than those in non-PDM cases. Short-term outcomes were evaluated only in CLS cases since the rate of hybrid surgery among RALS cases differed between non-PDM and PDM cases (0% vs. 44.4%), which would affect the surgical outcomes. The short-term outcomes in 447 CLS cases were similar between PDM and non-PDM cases. The frequency of extracorporeal division of the left colic artery (LCA) and IMV was significantly higher in PDM than in non-PDM cases (70.0% vs. 5.7%). This radiological definition of PDM was feasible. CLS for left-sided CRC with PDM was feasible, and dividing the LCA and IMV extracorporeally would be vital for safe surgery."

0,"Cardiovascular medication use and risks of colon cancer recurrences and additional cancer events: a cohort study. Cardiovascular medications may be associated with cancer development, but little is known about their association with cancer recurrence. Medications such as statins and antihypertensives may be commonly used among colon cancer survivors, who are, on average, diagnosed in their mid-60s. We described the associations between statins and antihypertensive medications and colon cancer recurrence in a large, population-based study. We conducted a cohort study among adults with stage I-IIIA colon cancer diagnosed in 1995–2014 in two Kaiser Permanente regions, Colorado and Washington. Statin and antihypertensive use were obtained from electronic pharmacy dispensing data. People were classified as medication users on the date of their first dispensing after cohort entry, which started 90 days after completing cancer treatment, continuing through the earliest of death, health plan disenrollment, or chart abstraction. We collected outcome information from medical record abstraction and tumor registries on colon cancer recurrences and second primary cancers. Using Cox proportional hazards multivariable models, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for colon cancer recurrences and any cancer event (recurrences and new primaries at any anatomic site) comparing medication users to non-users. Among 2039 people, 937 (46%) used statins and 1425 (70%) used antihypertensives at any point during a median of 4.9 years of follow-up; 460 people had any additional cancer event, including 152 with a colon cancer recurrence. Statin use was not associated with colon cancer recurrence (HR = 1.09, 95%CI = 0.65–1.85) or any cancer event (HR = 1.12, 95%CI = 0.85–1.47), nor was antihypertensive use associated with recurrence (HR = 0.73, 95%CI = 0.44–1.21) or any cancer event (HR = 0.93, 95%CI = 0.70–1.24). Our results suggest no association between cardiovascular medication use and the risk of recurrence or any additional cancer, and may provide reassurance to colon cancer survivors."

0,"Combined molecular and clinical approach for decision making for surgery in HNPCC patients: a report on three cases in two families. Hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is associated with highly penetrant germline mutations in mismatch repair genes. Due to a high lifetime risk in gene carriers for synchronous and for metachronous colorectal cancer and endometrial cancer in women, prophylactic and extended surgery are considered as options for gene carriers. A 54-year-old patient with a history of metachronous rectal cancer and a family history fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria presented with carcinoma of the cecum and highly dysplastic adenomas of the splenic flexure and descending colon. As a result of these findings, medical history and molecular diagnosis, the decision was made to perform colectomy and prophylactic hysterectomy with oophorectomy; histological examination of the specimen showed three synchronous colon carcinomas. The 31-year-old son carrying the pathogenic mutation refused to be included in the HNPCC surveillance program. One year later he presented with symptoms of bowel obstruction, and a carcinoma of the descending colon was diagnosed. Intraoperatively, in addition to the colon cancer, a small bowel cancer and peritoneal carcinomatosis were found. In another family fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria without known germline mutation a woman presented with synchronous cancer of the ascending colon and the lower rectum at the age of 49 years. Proctocolectomy and prophylactic hysterectomy were performed, which revealed an additional colon cancer and endometrial cancer. We discuss approaches for individual decision making for surgery in HNPCC patients. Is a subtotal colectomy indicated in the case of first colon cancer in HNPCC patients, or if the first tumor occurs in the lower rectum, should a proctocolectomy or a restorative proctocolectomy be considered? The aim of prospective clinical studies should be to assess acceptability, survival rates, mortality, and the quality of life in HNPCC patients who have undergone surveillance and standard oncological resections versus extended or prophylactic surgery."
0,"Risk of Advanced Proximal Adenoma and Cancer According to Rectosigmoid Findings in the Korean Population Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer death in the United States and Europe. Recently, the incidence of colorectal cancer has been increasing remarkably in Korea. To reduce the high incidence, screening of colorectal cancer in asymptomatic individuals has been advocated. Sigmoidoscopy is simpler, faster, and better tolerable than total colonoscopy, but the scope cannot reach the proximal colon segment and, therefore, may miss proximal colon cancer. In the present study, we intended to investigate the prevalence of proximal adenoma and cancer according to the findings in rectosigmoid colon and to find their risk factors. Data were collected retrospectively from 1541 consecutive patients who underwent total colonoscopy at the Department of Gastroenterology, Hanyang University, between October 2003 and December 2004. Neoplasms were classified as diminutive adenoma ( or =10 mm, with villous component or high-grade dysplasia), and cancer. The sites of neoplasms were defined as rectosigmoid (rectum and sigmoid colon) and proximal (from cecum to descending colon) colon. The prevalence of advanced proximal adenoma was associated with severe rectosigmoid findings. On the other hand, the prevalence of proximal colon cancer did not show such a tendency. Among the 131 patients with proximal advanced adenoma, 66% had no neoplasm in the rectosigmoid colon. Moreover, among the 27 patients with proximal cancer, 52% had no neoplasm in the rectosigmoid colon. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age, gender, and advanced rectosigmoid adenoma were the risk factors of advanced proximal adenoma, but nothing was associated with the risk for proximal colon cancer. Advanced rectosigmoid adenoma may be the predictor of advanced proximal adenoma, especially in old males. However, nothing is related to the risk for proximal colon cancer. Therefore, colonoscopy may be more adequate for colorectal cancer screening than sigmoidoscopy in the Korean population."

0,"Mesorectal fat area as a useful predictor of the difficulty of robotic-assisted laparoscopic total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer Various predictors of the difficulty of total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer have been described. Although a bulky mesorectum was considered to pose technical difficulties in total mesorectal excision, no studies have evaluated the influence of mesorectum morphology on the difficulty of total mesorectal excision. Mesorectal fat area at the level of the tip of the ischial spines on magnetic resonance imaging was described as a parameter characterizing mesorectum morphology. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of clinical and anatomical factors, including mesorectal fat area, on the difficulty of total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. This study enrolled 98 patients who underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic low anterior resection with total mesorectal excision for primary rectal cancer, performed by a single expert surgeon, between 2010 and 2015. Magnetic resonance imaging-based pelvimetry data were collected. Linear regression was performed to determine clinical and anatomical factors significantly associated with operative time of the pelvic phase, which was defined as the time interval from the start of rectal mobilization to the division of the rectum. The median operative time of the pelvic phase was 68 min (range 33–178 min). On univariate analysis, the following variables were significantly associated with longer operative time of the pelvic phase: male sex, larger tumor size, larger visceral fat area, larger mesorectal fat area, shorter pelvic outlet length, longer sacral length, shorter interspinous distance, larger pelvic inlet angle, and smaller angle between the lines connecting the coccyx to S3 and to the inferior middle aspect of the pubic symphysis. On multiple linear regression analysis, only larger mesorectal fat area remained significantly associated with longer operative time of the pelvic phase (p = 0.009). Mesorectal fat area may serve as a useful predictor of the difficulty of total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer."
0,"Kisspeptin Effect on Endothelial Monocyte Activating Polypeptide II (EMAP-II)-Associated Lymphocyte Cell Death and Metastases in Colorectal Cancer Patients Kisspeptin is an antimetastatic agent in some cancers that has also been associated with lymphoid cell apoptosis, a phenomenon favoring metastases. Our aim was to determine the association of kisspeptin with lymphocyte apoptosis and the presence of metastases in colorectal cancer patients. Blood was drawn from 69 colon cancer patients and 20 healthy volunteers. Tissue specimens from healthy and pathological tissue were immunohistochemically analyzed for kisspeptin and endothelial monocyte activating polypeptide II (EMAP-II) expression. Blood EMAP-II and soluble Fas ligand (sFasL) levels were examined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The kisspeptin and EMAP-II expression and secretion levels in the DLD-1 and HT-29 colon cancer cell lines were examined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas lymphocyte viability was assessed by flow cytometry. The effect of kisspeptin on the viability of colon cancer cells was examined by MTT [3-(4),5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide]. Exogenous, synthetic and naturally produced, kisspeptin induces through the G-protein-coupled receptor 54 (GPR54; also known as the kisspeptin receptor) the EMAP-II expression and secretion in colon cancer cell lines, inducing in vitro lymphocyte apoptosis, as verified by the use of an anti-EMAP-II antibody. These results were reversed with the use of kisspeptin inhibitors and by kisspeptin-silencing experiments. Tumor kisspeptin expression was associated with the tumor EMAP-II expression (p < 0.001). Elevated kisspeptin and EMAP-II expression in colon cancer tissues was associated with lack of metastases (p < 0.001) in colon cancer patients. These data indicate the antimetastatic effect of tumor-elevated kisspeptin in colon cancer patients that may be mediated by the effect of kisspeptin on EMAP-II expression in colon cancer tumors in patients with normal serum EMAP-II levels. These findings provide new insight into the role of kisspeptin in the context of metastases in colon cancer patients."

The CXCL14 was selected for further analysis for its most significant P value. Single-cell analysis showed that the CXCL14 was mainly expressed in the fibroblasts. Meanwhile, the biological role of fibroblasts in the colon cancer microenvironment was investigated. Further, the clinical role of CXCL14 in colon cancer was also explored. The result showed that the CXCL14 is a protective factor against colon cancer independent of other clinical parameters like age, gender, clinical stage, and TNM classifications. Then, biological enrichment analysis indicated that the CXCL14 is predominantly involved in the activating of the WNT/β/catenin pathway, pancreas beta cells, peroxisome and bile acid metabolism. Immune infiltration analysis showed that for the patients with high CXCL14 levels, the plasma B cells, CD8 + T cells, neutrophil and NK cells might infiltrate more, in contrast to B cells, monocyte and macrophages.

0,"Types and amount of dietary fat and colon cancer risk: Prevention by omega-3 fatty acid-rich diets Colorectal cancer is the second most common malignancy in the Western world including the United Sates. In recent years there is a strong upward trend in colon cancer risk in Japan mainly due to Americanization of Japanese food habits. Several epidemiological studies point to a strong association between nutrient composition of the diet and cancer of the colon. The role of types of dietary fat, especially saturated fats of animal origin, n−6- and n−3-rich polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the etiology of colorectal cancer has become increasingly apparent. Epidemiological studies indicate a positive association between the dietary intake of saturated fat and/or animal fat and colon cancer risk and an inverse relationship between the intake of fish and fish oil rich in n−3 PUFAs and colon cancer development. Although the evidence from case-control studies and international correlational studies is not totally consistent, these inconsistencies may have arisen, at least in part, from methodological limitations. Animal, model studies have unequivocally provided evidence that the colon tumor-promoting effect of dietary fat depends on its fatty acid composition and that high dietary n−3 PUFAs lacks colon tumor-promoting effect, as compared to diets high in n−6 PUFAs or saturated fats. Diets rich in n−3 PUFAs inhibit colon carcinogenesis through the modulation of colonicras-p21, cyclooxygenase-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase activities and apoptosis. Gene expression analysis using DNA microarrays indicates that n−3 fatty acid, docosahexaenoic acid activates cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors such as p21, p27, p57 and p19 and inactivates antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family of genes, and prostagland in family of genes. These results suggest that decreasing the intake of n−6 PUFAs and saturated fats and increasing that of n−3 PUFAs, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid has the potential to be a major component of colon cancer control."
0,"Linc00659, a long noncoding RNA, acts as novel oncogene in regulating cancer cell growth in colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers and causes of cancer-related death worldwide. In patients with CRC, metastasis is a crucial problem that leads to treatment failure and is the primary cause of the lethality of colon cancer. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as critical molecules in the development, cell growth, apoptosis, and metastasis of CRC. We investigated the transcriptome profiles of human lncRNAs in the primary tumor tissues and in the corresponding normal mucosa of two patients with CRC by using a microarray approach. The expression levels of lncRNAs were verified in colon cancer by real-time PCR. Using bioinformatics approach to illustrate putative biological function of Linc00659 in colon cancer. The effects of Linc00659 on cell growth, proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis were studies by in vitro assays. Our data revealed that compared with adjacent normal tissues, 201 lncRNAs were deregulated (fold change ≥ 4 or ≤ 0.25) in CRC tissues. Among them, the expression levels of Linc00659 were significantly increased in colon cancer, and high expression levels were correlated with poor survival in patients with CRC. Bioinformatics analysis results indicated that Linc00659 was significantly coexpressed with cycle-related genes in CRC. Linc00659 expression knockdown could significantly suppress colon cancer cell growth by impairing cell cycle progression. In addition, our results showed that Linc00659 expression knockdown could accelerate cell apoptosis in colon cancer cells treated with chemotherapy drugs. Meanwhile, our results also demonstrated that silencing of Linc00659 expression leads to cell growth inhibition and induced apoptosis, possibly by suppressing PI3K-AKT signaling in colon cancer. Linc00659 is a novel oncogenic lncRNA involved in colon cancer cell growth by modulating the cell cycle. Our findings give an insight into lncRNA regulation and provide an application for colon cancer therapy."
0,"Co-expression of nuclear and cytoplasmic HMGB1 is inversely associated with infiltration of CD45RO+ T cells and prognosis in patients with stage IIIB colon cancer. Background: The intratumoral infiltration of T cells, especially memory T cells, is associated with a favorable prognosis in early colorectal cancers. However, the mechanism underlying this process remains elusive. This study examined whether high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) molecule, is involved in the infiltration of T cells and disease progression in locally advanced colon cancer. Methods: Seventy-two cases of pathologically-confirmed specimens were obtained from patients with stage IIIB (T3N1M0) colon cancer who underwent radical resection between January 1999 and May 2002 at the Cancer Center of Sun Yat-Sen University. The density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) within the tumor tissue and the expression of HMGB1 in the cancer cells were examined via immunohistochemical analysis. The phenotype of CD45RO+ cells was confirmed using a flow cytometric assay. The association between HMGB1 expression, the density of TILs, and the 5-year survival rate were analyzed. Results: The density of CD45RO+ T cells within the tumor was independently prognostic, although a higher density of CD3+ T cells was also associated with a favorable prognosis. More importantly, the expression of HMGB1 was observed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (co-expression pattern) in a subset of colon cancer tissues, whereas nuclear-only expression of HMGB1 (nuclear expression pattern) existed in most of the cancer tissues and normal mucosa. The co-expression pattern of HMGB1 in colon cancer cells was inversely associated with the infiltration of both CD3+ and CD45RO+ T cells and 5-year survival rates. Conclusions: This study revealed that the co-expression of HMGB1 is inversely associated with the infiltration of CD45RO+ T cells and prognosis in patients with stage IIIB colon cancer, indicating that the distribution patterns of HMGB1 might contribute to the progression of colon cancer via modulation of the local immune response."
0,"Reduced colon cancer incidence and mortality in postmenopausal women treated with an oral bisphosphonate--Danish National Register Based Cohort Study. In this Danish national register-based cohort study, we examined the effects of alendronate on the development of colon cancers and survival. The incidence of colon cancer and mortality rate, once colon cancer had been diagnosed, were lower in patients treated with alendronate, posing the question whether alendronate acts as chemopreventive. When bisphosphonates are given by mouth, around 99% remains non-absorbed in the intestine. Based on their biochemical actions, we predicted that oral bisphosphonates might prevent colon cancers. This is a Danish national register-based cohort study. We identified 30,606 women aged 50+, mean age 71.9 years, who had not previously taken treatments for osteoporosis, who began to take alendronate in 1996–2005, and assigned 124,424 individually age- and gender-matched control subjects. The main outcome measure was colorectal cancers incidence and post-diagnosis survival in patients taking oral alendronate for osteoporosis. Cox proportional hazards analysis of death due to colon cancer showed lower risk in alendronate users, crude hazard ratio (HR) 0.69 (95% CI 0.59–0.81) with an adjusted HR of 0.62 (95% CI 0.52–0.72). The reduction in risk comprised both a lower incidence of colon cancer-adjusted HR 0.69 (95% CI 0.60–0.79) and a lower mortality once colon cancer had been diagnosed, adjusted HR 0.82 (95% CI 0.70–0.97). Weekly alendronate was associated with a greater risk reduction than daily alendronate. The main findings were unaffected by excluding patients from the analysis who had pulmonary disease, a major co-morbid condition in users of alendronate and an important cause of death. The risk of overall deaths from cancer and in particular death caused by colon cancer was significantly and substantially decreased (40%) in patients treated with alendronate, with survival curves deviating progressively after 2 years. Also, the incidence of colon cancer was lower in those patients."

0,"P4HA3 promotes colon cancer cell escape from macrophage phagocytosis by increasing phagocytosis immune checkpoint CD47 expression. Cancer immunotherapies have greatly changed the prospects for the therapy of many malignancies, including colon cancer. Macrophages as the effectors of cancer immunotherapy provide considerable promise for cancer treatment. Prolyl 4-hydroxylase subunit alpha 3 (P4HA3) plays a cancer-promoting role in a variety of cancers, including colon cancer. In the present work, we provided evidence for the first time that P4HA3 promoted colon cancer cell escape from macrophage phagocytosis, and preliminarily explored its possible molecular mechanism. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of P4HA3 in tissues. Bioinformatics methods were used to analyze the tumor public databases (including TCGA database and GEO database). Macrophage phagocytosis assay and flow cytometric analysis were used to detect the phagocytic capacity of macrophages. Western blot and qRT-PCR were used to detect the expression of related markers (such as P4HA3, CD47, CD24, IL-34, and M-CSF). First, we found that P4HA3 was significantly and highly expressed in both colon cancer tissues and cells, and that P4HA3 had a positive correlation with lymph node metastasis, Dukes stage and also strongly correlated with poorer survival. Subsequently, we found that P4HA3 was strongly associated with the macrophage infiltration level in colon cancer. Immediately we also found that decreasing P4HA3 expression promoted macrophage phagocytosis in colon cancer cells, whereas P4HA3 overexpression produced the opposite effect. Finally, we demonstrated that P4HA3 promoted the expression of cluster of differentiation 47 (CD47) in colon cancer cells. Moreover, P4HA3 caused colon cancer cells to secrete Interleukin 34 (IL34) and Macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), which further induced macrophages to differentiate to M2 type and thereby contributed to the progression of colon cancer. We have demonstrated that P4HA3-driven CD47 overexpression may act as an escape mechanism, causing colon cancer cells to evade phagocytosis from macrophages."

We investigated the efficacy and safety of adjuvant immunochemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy for colorectal cancer, using different combinations of the intracutaneous streptococcal preparation OK-432 and the oral pyrimidines 1-hexylcarbamoyl-5-fluorouracil (carmofur, HCFU) and uracil/tegafur (UFT). Patients with stage II, III, or IV (Dukes’ B, C) colorectal cancer were enrolled and randomly assigned to one of three groups: an immunochemotherapy group (mitomycin C [MMC] + 5-fluorouracil [5-FU] + HCFU + OK-432), a chemotherapy group (MMC + 5-FU + HCFU), and a control group (surgery alone) for those with colon cancer (study 1); and an immunochemotherapy group (MMC + 5-FU + UFT + OK-432), a chemotherapy group (MMC + 5-FU + UFT), and a control group (surgery alone) for those with rectal cancer (study 2). A total of 760 patients with colon cancer and 669 patients with rectal cancer were entered into this randomized clinical trial (RCT). The incidence of side-effects was in the order of: immunochemotherapy group ≫ chemotherapy group ≫ control group in both the cohort of patients with colon cancer and the cohort with rectal cancer. In particular, the frequency of leucopenia and skin disorders was significantly higher than control groups. There were no severe adverse events such as death related to the adjuvant therapy. In both the colon cancer and rectal cancer cohorts, no significant difference in the 5-year survival rate and disease-free survival rate was noted among the three groups. The results of an RCT demonstrated that the combination of MMC + 5-FU + HCFU + OK-432 for colon cancer and that of MMC + 5-FU + UFT + OK-432 for rectal cancer could not prolong the survival of patients with surgically resected colorectal cancer, but that both combinations were well tolerated as adjuvant therapy."
0,"Spontaneous regression of advanced transverse colon cancer with remaining lymph node metastasis. The observation of spontaneous regression (SR) has been well documented for many cancer types, including renal cell carcinoma, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, leukemia, neuroblastoma, and malignant melanoma. However, the SR frequency in colorectal cancer is very rare. Therefore, the accumulation of SR colorectal cancer cases might contribute to find the regression mechanism. A 67-year-old woman received colonoscopy due to being positive for fecal occult blood testing and was diagnosed as having a transverse colon cancer at a local hospital. She was admitted to our institution for surgical treatment of the colon cancer. The colonoscopy revealed a type 2 tumor of 13 mm in diameter at the hepatic flexure of the transverse colon. The enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed an enlarged lymph node in the intermediate lymph node region. The 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT showed no abnormal accumulation on the transverse colon; however, an abnormal accumulation was found at the enlarged lymph node. The patient was preoperatively diagnosed as having advanced transverse colon cancer with lymph node metastasis and underwent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy with D3 lymph node dissection. Pathological examination showed only a scar-like tissue and no cancerous lesion in the transverse colon, while a metastatic lymph node was histologically confirmed in the intermediate lymph node region. Loss of MLH1 and PMS2 expression was observed in the cancer cells of both biopsy specimens and resected lymph nodes. No recurrence was seen for 5 years after surgery. We reported a rare case of SR of the primary transverse colon cancer without regression of the metastatic regional lymph node. We considered that colorectal cancer with SR should be resected because even if SR of the primary lesion occurs, lymph node metastasis might have an inconsistent behavior as shown in the present case."

0,"Contribution of extended family history in assessment of risk for breast and colon cancer Family history is important for identifying candidates for high risk cancer screening and referral for genetic counseling. We sought to determine the percentage of individuals who would be eligible for high risk cancer screening or genetic referral and testing if family history includes an extended (vs limited) family history. Family histories were obtained from 626 women at UVMMC associated mammography centers from 2001 to 2002. ACS guidelines were used to determine eligibility for high risk breast or colon cancer screening. Eligibility for referral for genetic counseling for hereditary breast and colon cancer was determined using the Referral Screening Tool and Amsterdam II screening criteria, respectively. All family histories were assessed for eligibility by a limited history (first degree relatives only) and extended history (first and second degree relatives). Four hundred ninety-nine histories were eligible for review. 18/282 (3.6 %) and 62/123 (12 %) individuals met criteria for high risk breast and colon cancer screening, respectively. 13/18 (72 %) in the high risk breast cancer screening group and 12/62 (19 %) in the high risk colon cancer screening group met criteria based upon an extended family history. 9/282 (1.8 %) and 31/123 (6.2 %) individuals met criteria for genetic counseling referral and testing for breast and colon cancer, respectively. 2/9 (22 %) of individuals in the genetic breast cancer screening group and 21/31 (68 %) individuals in the genetic colon cancer screening group met criteria based upon extended family history. This is one of the first studies to suggest that first degree family history alone is not adequate for identification of candidates for high risk screening and referral for genetic counseling for hereditary breast and colon cancer syndromes. A larger population is needed to further validate this data."
0,"Comprehensive analyses of correlation and survival reveal informative lncRNA prognostic signatures in colon cancer Colon cancer is a commonly worldwide cancer with high morbidity and mortality. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in many biological processes and are closely related to the occurrence of colon cancer. Identification of the prognostic signatures of lncRNAs in colon cancer has great significance for its treatment. We first identified the colon cancer-related mRNAs and lncRNAs according to the differential analysis methods using the expression data in TCGA. Then, we performed correlation analysis between the identified mRNAs and lncRNAs by integrating their expression values and secondary structure information to estimate the co-regulatory relationships between the cancer-related mRNAs and lncRNAs. Besides, the competing endogenous RNA regulation network based on co-regulatory relationships was constructed to reveal cancer-related regulatory patterns. Meanwhile, we used traditional regression analysis (univariate Cox analysis, random survival forest analysis, and lasso regression analysis) to screen the cancer-related lncRNAs. Finally, by combining the identified colon cancer-related lncRNAs according to the above analyses, we constructed a risk prognosis model for colon cancer through multivariate Cox analysis and also validated the model in the colon cancer dataset in TCGA cohorts. Six lncRNAs were found highly correlated with the overall survival of colon cancer patients, and a risk prognosis model based on them was constructed to predict the overall survival of colon cancer patients. In particular, EVX1-AS, ZNF667-AS1, CTC-428G20.6, and CTC-297N7.9 were first reported to be related to colon cancer by using our model, among which EVX1-AS and ZNF667-AS1 have been predicted to be related to colon cancer in LncRNADisease database. This study identified the potential regulatory relationships between lncRNAs and mRNAs by integrating their expression values and secondary structure information and presented a significant 6-lncRNA risk prognosis model to predict the overall survival of colon cancer patients."
0,"Laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer with persistent descending mesocolon. Persistent descending mesocolon (PDM) is caused by the absence of fusion of the descending colon to the retroperitoneum. We herein report two colorectal cancer cases with PDM that were treated with laparoscopic surgery. Case 1: a 50-year-old man with sigmoid colon cancer and synchronous liver metastasis. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, he underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy with lymph node dissection cutting the root of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) and synchronous liver resection. He experienced postoperative stenosis of the reconstructed colon possibly due to an impaired arterial blood flow in the reconstructed colon. Case 2: a 77-year-old man with rectal cancer. Laparoscopic low anterior resection preserving the left colic artery (LCA) was performed. Intraoperative infrared ray (IR) imaging using indocyanine green (ICG) showed good blood flow of the reconstructed colon. He had no postoperative complications. In cases of PDM, the mesentery of the descending and sigmoid colon containing the LCA is often shortened, and the marginal artery of the reconstructed colon is located close to the root of the LCA. Lymph node dissection accompanied by cutting the LCA carries a risk of marginal artery injury. Therefore, we recommend lymph node dissection preserving the LCA in colorectal cancer patients with PDM in order to maintain the blood flow of the reconstructed colon. If the IMA and LCA absolutely need to be cut for complete lymph node dissection, the marginal artery should be clearly identified and preserved. In addition, intraoperative IR imaging is extremely useful for evaluating colonic perfusion and reducing the risk of anastomotic complications. In colorectal cancer surgery in patients with PDM, surgeons should be aware of these tips for maintaining the blood flow of the reconstructed colon and thereby avoid postoperative complications caused by an impaired blood flow."

0,"NF-κB maintains the stemness of colon cancer cells by downregulating miR-195-5p/497-5p and upregulating MCM2. Colon cancer represents one of the leading causes of gastrointestinal tumors in industrialized countries, and its incidence appears to be increasing at an alarming rate. Accumulating evidence has unveiled the contributory roles of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in tumorigenicity, recurrence, and metastases. The functions of NF-kappa B (NF-κB) activation on cancer cell survival, including colon cancer cells have encouraged us to study the role of NF-κB in the maintenance of CSCs in colon cancer. Tumor samples and matched normal samples were obtained from 35 colon cancer cases. CSCs were isolated from human colon cancer cell lines, where the stemness of the cells was evaluated by cell viability, colony-forming, spheroid-forming, invasion, migration, and apoptosis assays. NF-κB activation was then performed in subcutaneous tumor models of CSCs by injecting lipopolysaccharides (LPS) i.p. We found that NF-κB activation could reduce the expression of miR-195-5p and miR-497-5p, where these two miRNAs were determined to be downregulated in colon cancer tissues, cultured colon CSCs, and LPS-injected subcutaneous tumor models. Elevation of miR-195-5p and miR-497-5p levels by their specific mimic could ablate the effects of NF-κB on the stemness of colon cancer cells in vivo and in vitro, suggesting that NF-κB could maintain the stemness of colon cancer cells by downregulating miR-195-5p/497–5p. MCM2 was validated as the target gene of miR-195-5p and miR-497-5p in cultured colon CSCs. Overexpression of MCM2 was shown to restore the stemness of colon cancer cells in the presence of miR-195-5p and miR-497-5p, suggesting that miR-195-5p and miR-497-5p could impair the stemness of colon cancer cells by targeting MCM2 in vivo and in vitro. Our work demonstrates that the restoration of miR-195-5p and miR-497-5p may be a therapeutic strategy for colon cancer treatment in relation to NF-κB activation."

0,"DACT2 is a functional tumor suppressor through inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin pathway and associated with poor survival in colon cancer. Dapper homolog (DACT) 2 is one of the Dact gene family members, which are important modulators of Wnt signaling pathway. We aim to clarify its epigenetic inactivation, biological function and clinical implication in colon cancer. DACT2 was silenced in five out of eight colon cancer cell lines, but robustly expressed in normal colon tissues. The loss of DACT2 expression was regulated by promoter hypermethylation. Restoring DACT2 expression in colon cancer cell lines suppressed tumor cell growth by inducing cell apoptosis and inhibiting cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, DACT2 overexpression effectively reduced lung metastasis of colon cancer cells in nude mice. These effects by DACT2 were attributed to inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Reexpression of DACT2 significantly suppressed the transcriptional activity of both wild-type β-catenin and degradation-resistant form mutant β-catenin (S33Y). DACT2 could actively shuttle into and out of nuclei, with its predominant steady-state localization in the cytoplasm dependent on its nuclear export signal. Co-immunoprecipitation results indicated that DACT2 strongly associated β-catenin as well as lymphoid enhancer-binding factor 1 (LEF1) and directly disrupted the formation of the β-catenin–LEF1 complex in the nucleus. Whereas in the cytoplasm, DACT2 restored junctional localization of E-cadherin–β-catenin complexes and prevented β-catenin nuclear translocation through direct interaction with β-catenin. DACT2 methylation was detected in 43.3% (29/67) of colon cancer tissues, but none in normal controls. Multivariate analysis revealed that patients with DACT2 methylation had a significant decrease in overall survival (P=0.006). Kaplan–Meier survival curves showed that DACT2 methylation was significantly associated with shortened survival in stage I–III colon cancer patients. In conclusion, DACT2 acts as a functional tumor suppressor in colon cancer through inhibiting Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Its methylation at early stages of colon carcinogenesis is an independent prognostic factor."
0,"Reproductive factors and colon cancers. In Los Angeles County, the age-adjusted incidence rate of colon cancer in men is almost 30% higher than that in women; however, in the descending and sigmoid colon, age-specific incidence rates for women are higher than those for men before age 55. Since menstrual and/or reproductive factors may be involved in producing this crossover in age-specific rates, they were examined in a population-based case-control study involving 327 white women with adenocarcinoma of the colon and age-, race- and neighbourhood-matched controls. After adjustment for other factors associated with colon cancer in this study (family history of large bowel cancer, total fat intake, calcium, weight and activity level), ever having been pregnant was protective (RR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.33-0.97). For one to two pregnancies, the RR was 0.76 (CI = 0.42-1.37); for three or more pregnancies, the RR was 0.45 (CI = 0.25-0.81). However, the relationship between the number of pregnancies and colon cancer risk was actually U-shaped, with risk decreasing with successive pregnancies up to four and then increasing with additional pregnancies. The U-shaped relationship was present for incomplete as well as for full-term pregnancies and was more striking for cancers occurring in the distal (descending and sigmoid) than proximal (caecum to splenic flexure) colon. Risk was not related to age at menarche or use of exogenous oestrogens, but delayed natural menopause was weakly protective in the proximal but not distal colon. The crossover in incidence rates in the distal colon can be completely accounted for by the pregnancy effect. The U-shape of the pregnancy curve suggests the possibility of competing factors, some protective, especially after one or several pregnancies, and others conferring increasing risk with successive pregnancies, regardless of the pregnancy outcome."
0,"Has National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month increased endoscopy screening rates and public interest in colorectal cancer National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month occurs each March to promote awareness and screening for colorectal cancer. The effectiveness of this public health campaign is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month on rates of screening endoscopies and on public interest in colorectal cancer. To examine the impact of National Colon Cancer Awareness Month on screening endoscopy rates, the National Endoscopy Database was retrospectively reviewed from 2002 through 2014. A time series of monthly number of colorectal cancer screening endoscopies per endoscopist in the data set was evaluated. To examine public interest in colorectal cancer, Google Trends data were collected on the monthly rates of terms related to colorectal cancer from January 2004 to July 2019. Impact of the month on screening endoscopies and public interest was assessed through an analysis of variance. Seasonality was tested for by how well a sinusoidal model fit the time series as opposed to a linear model utilizing a sum-of-squares F test. Review of National Endoscopy Database yielded 1,398,996 endoscopies, 94% were colonoscopies and 6% sigmoidoscopies, with 47% for colorectal cancer screening. Colorectal cancer screening endoscopy rates were not impacted by the month of the year, and these rates had no seasonality. However, Google searches related to colorectal cancer were significantly impacted by month of the year, specifically March, with significant seasonality observed in the data. National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month is associated with an increased public interest in colorectal cancer based on user Google search trends. Yet, this has not translated into a demonstrable increase in the rates of screening. This presents an opportunity to capitalize on this increased public interest and harness this enthusiasm into increased screening."

0,"Teng-Long-Bu-Zhong-Tang, a Chinese herbal formula, enhances anticancer effects of 5--Fluorouracil in CT26 colon carcinoma. Colorectal cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has played a positive role in colorectal cancer treatment. There is a great need to establish effective herbal formula for colorectal cancer treatment. Based on TCM principles and clinical practices, we have established an eight herbs composed formula for colorectal cancer treatment, which is Teng-Long-Bu-Zhong-Tang (TLBZT). We have demonstrated the anticancer effects of TLBZT against colorectal carcinoma in vitro. In present study, we evaluated the anticancer potential of TLBZT, used alone or in combination with low dose of 5-Fluorouracil (5-Fu), in CT26 colon carcinoma in vivo. CT26 colon carcinoma was established in BALB/c mice and treated with TLBZT, 5-Fu, or TLBZT plus 5-Fu. The tumor volumes were observed. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay. Caspases activities were detected by colorimetric assay. Cell senescence was indentified by senescence β-galactosidase staining. Gene expression and angiogenesis was observed by immunohistochemistry or western blot. TLBZT significantly inhibited CT26 colon carcinoma growth. TLBZT elicited apoptosis in CT26 colon carcinoma, accompanied by Caspase-3, 8, and 9 activation and PARP cleavage, and downregulation of XIAP and Survivin. TLBZT also induced cell senescence in CT26 colon carcinoma, with concomitant upregulation of p16 and p21 and downregulation of RB phosphorylation. In addition, angiogenesis and VEGF expression in CT26 colon carcinoma was significantly inhibited by TLBZT treatment. Furthermore, TLBZT significantly enhanced anticancer effects of 5-Fu in CT26 colon carcinoma. TLBZT exhibited significantly anticancer effect, and enhanced the effects of 5-Fu in CT26 colon carcinoma, which may correlate with induction of apoptosis and cell senescence, and angiogenesis inhibition. The present study provides new insight into TCM approaches for colon cancer treatment that are worth of further study."
0,"Applications of Colon Capsule Endoscopy This is a review of colon capsule endoscopy (CCE) with a focus on its recent developments, technological improvements, and current and potential future indications. Based on the current literature, CCE II demonstrates comparable polyp detection rates as optical colonoscopy and CT colonography, and improved cost-effectiveness. The main limitation to patient acceptance is the requirement of a rigorous bowel preparation. Preliminary studies show good correlation between CCE and optical colonoscopy for assessment of colonic disease activity in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). CCE II is currently FDA, approved as an adjunctive test in patients with prior incomplete colonoscopy, and in the evaluation of patients with suspected lower gastrointestinal bleeding. The test is approved in Europe as one of the options for average-risk colorectal cancer screening, and high-risk screening in patients with contraindications or unwilling to undergo colonoscopy. CCE has a potential role in the evaluation and monitoring of colonic disease activity in IBD. Future technological advances should focus on minimizing bowel preparation, improvement in reading times, and development of therapeutic capabilities. • With technological improvements, the second-generation colon capsule has a significantly higher sensitivity than the first-generation capsule for detection of colon polyps. • Colon capsule endoscopy has been approved in Europe as an option for average-risk colorectal cancer screening, and high-risk screening in patients with contraindications or unwilling to undergo colonoscopy. • Colon capsule endoscopy has received FDA approval as an option for colorectal cancer screening in patients with prior incomplete colonoscopy, and in evaluation of patients with suspected lower gastrointestinal bleeding. • Colon capsule endoscopy may have a role in evaluation and monitoring of inflammatory bowel disease. • Colon capsule endoscopy currently requires a bowel preparation that is more rigorous than colonoscopy."
0,"Lung and colon cancer classification using medical imaging: a feature engineering approach. Lung and colon cancers lead to a significant portion of deaths. Their simultaneous occurrence is uncommon, however, in the absence of early diagnosis, the metastasis of cancer cells is very high between these two organs. Currently, histopathological diagnosis and appropriate treatment are the only way to improve the chances of survival and reduce cancer mortality. Using artificial intelligence in the histopathological diagnosis of colon and lung cancer can provide significant help to specialists in identifying cases of colon and lung cancers with less effort, time and cost. The objective of this study is to set up a computer-aided diagnostic system that can accurately classify five types of colon and lung tissues (two classes for colon cancer and three classes for lung cancer) by analyzing their histopathological images. Using machine learning, features engineering and image processing techniques, the six models XGBoost, SVM, RF, LDA, MLP and LightGBM were used to perform the classification of histopathological images of lung and colon cancers that were acquired from the LC25000 dataset. The main advantage of using machine learning models is that they allow a better interpretability of the classification model since they are based on feature engineering; however, deep learning models are black box networks whose working is very difficult to understand due to the complex network design. The acquired experimental results show that machine learning models give satisfactory results and are very precise in identifying classes of lung and colon cancer subtypes. The XGBoost model gave the best performance with an accuracy of 99% and a F1-score of 98.8%. The implementation and the development of this model will help healthcare specialists identify types of colon and lung cancers. The code will be available upon request."

0,"Prognostic value of total number of lymph nodes retrieved differs between left-sided colon cancer and right-sided colon cancer in stage III patients with colon cancer. The consensus is that a minimum of 12 lymph nodes should be analyzed at colectomy for colon cancer. However, right colon cancer and left colon cancer have different characteristics, and this threshold value for total number of lymph nodes retrieved may not be universally applicable. The data of 63,243 patients with colon cancer treated between 2004 and 2012 were retrieved from the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was used to determine the predictive value of total number of lymph nodes for survival after adjusting for lymph nodes ratio. The predictive value in left-sided colon cancer and right-sided colon cancer was compared. The optimal total number of lymph nodes cutoff value for prediction of overall survival was identified using the online tool Cutoff Finder. Survival of patients with high total number of lymph nodes (≥12) and low total number of lymph nodes (< 12) was compared by Kaplan–Meier analysis. After stratifying by lymph nodes ratio status, total number of lymph nodes≥12 remained an independent predictor of survival in the whole cohort and in right-sided colon cancer, but not in left-sided colon cancer. The optimal cutoff value for total number of lymph nodes was determined to be 11. Low total number of lymph nodes (< 11) was associated with significantly poorer survival after adjusting for lymph nodes ratio in all subgroups except in the subgroup with high lymph nodes ratio (0.5–1.0). Previous reports of the prognostic significance of total number of lymph nodes on node-positive colon cancer were confounded by lymph nodes ratio. The 12-node standard for total number of lymph nodes may not be equally applicable in right-sided colon cancer and left-sided colon cancer."
0,"MASTL induces Colon Cancer progression and Chemoresistance by promoting Wnt/β-catenin signaling Chemotherapeutic agents that modulate cell cycle checkpoints and/or tumor-specific pathways have shown immense promise in preclinical and clinical studies aimed at anti-cancer therapy. MASTL (Greatwall in Xenopus and Drosophila), a serine/threonine kinase controls the final G2/M checkpoint and prevents premature entry of cells into mitosis. Recent studies suggest that MASTL expression is highly upregulated in cancer and confers resistance against chemotherapy. However, the role and mechanism/s of MASTL mediated regulation of tumorigenesis remains poorly understood. We utilized a large patient cohort and mouse models of colon cancer as well as colon cancer cells to determine the role of Mastl and associated mechanism in colon cancer. Here, we show that MASTL expression increases in colon cancer across all cancer stages compared with normal colon tissue (P < 0.001). Also, increased levels of MASTL associated with high-risk of the disease and poor prognosis. Further, the shRNA silencing of MASTL expression in colon cancer cells induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in vitro and inhibited xenograft-tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistic analysis revealed that MASTL expression facilitates colon cancer progression by promoting the β-catenin/Wnt signaling, the key signaling pathway implicated in colon carcinogenesis, and up-regulating anti-apoptotic proteins, Bcl-xL and Survivin. Further studies where colorectal cancer (CRC) cells were subjected to 5-fluorouracil (5FU) treatment revealed a sharp increase in MASTL expression upon chemotherapy, along with increases in Bcl-xL and Survivin expression. Most notably, inhibition of MASTL in these cells induced chemosensitivity to 5FU with downregulation of Survivin and Bcl-xL expression. Overall, our data shed light on the heretofore-undescribed mechanistic role of MASTL in key oncogenic signaling pathway/s to regulate colon cancer progression and chemo-resistance that would tremendously help to overcome drug resistance in colon cancer treatment."
0,"Environmental factors affect colon carcinoma and rectal carcinoma in men and women differently Colon cancer is thought to be more closely associated with environmental factors than rectal cancer, but evidence is currently insufficient. We examined whether there are differences in the degree of environmental effect on colon cancer and rectal cancer in Japan. We performed a birth cohort analysis for colon and rectal cancers using Japanese vital statistics from 1950 to 1998 and analyzed time trends by cancer site and gender. The mean annual increase in age-adjusted mortality rate from colon cancer was greater than that from rectal cancer and was greater in men than in women. In men left colon cancer showed the greatest rate of increase whereas cancer of the right colon showed only a slight change. Although left colon cancer rapidly increased until the middle 1980s and thereafter showed no change, right colon cancer showed no change until the middle 1980s and thereafter rapidly increased in men. However, the rates of increase in left colon cancer were greater than those in right colon cancer until the middle 1980s, after which a reversal in trend was seen in women. Birth cohort analysis indicates that for all cohorts the mortality rates at the same age were higher in the recent cohorts than in the previous ones. This trend was more marked for colon cancer than for rectal cancer and was stronger among men than among women. Colon cancer is more closely associated than rectal cancer with environmental factors, and this association is more pronounced in men than in women. Consequently cancers at these two sites should not be combined in studies of the role of lifestyle factors in causing these neoplasms. Furthermore, the causes of these diseases may differ in men and women."
0,"Potentiation of antitumor and antimetastatic activities of adriamycin by a novel N-alkylated dihydropyridine, AC394, and its enantiomers in colon cancer-bearing mice Purpose: We have previously shown that a series of N-alkylated 1,4-dihydropyridines potentiate the therapeutic efficacy of vincristine in vincristine-resistant P388 leukemia. The purpose of this study was to investigate the ability of one of the compounds, AC394, and its enantiomers to potentiate the antitumor activity of adriamycin against colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Methods: The effects of AC394 on potentiation of adriamycin cytotoxicity and enhancement of its accumulation were evaluated using colon 26, HCT-15 and MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, the activities of AC394 and its enantiomers were compared. We also studied the combined effects of (+)-AC394 and adriamycin on subcutaneously (s.c.)-implanted and liver metastasis tumor models. Results: AC394 potentiated the cytotoxicity of adriamycin and enhanced its accumulation in colon cancer cells (colon 26 and HCT-15), which are known to express P-GP (P-glycoprotein) intrinsically. Enhancement of adriamycin accumulation by AC394 was found in s.c.-implanted colon 26 cells in vivo. Although both enantiomers of AC394 showed equal activity in vitro, (+)-AC394 was more effective than (−)-AC394 given orally. (−)-AC394 was found to be cleared more rapidly from the plasma than (+)-AC394. Thus, (+)-AC394 was evaluated for further study. Administration of (+)-AC394 significantly potentiated the antitumor activities of adriamycin in human colon cancer HCT-15 cells implanted s.c. Furthermore, in the liver metastasis model using colon 26 cells, a model completely resistant to adriamycin, the combination therapy of adriamycin with (+)-AC394 produced superior antitumor effects over adriamycin alone. Conclusions: A newly synthesized N-alkylated 1,4-dihydropyridine derivative, (+)-AC394, showed superior effects on the potentiation of adriamycin antitumor and antimetastatic activities in vivo. These results suggest that this combination may have therapeutic efficacy not only against primary colon cancers but also against metastatic liver cancer."
0,"Local recurrence after curative resection in patients with colon and rectal cancers. There are a range of rates and a number of prognostic factors associated with the local recurrence of colorectal cancer after curative resection. The aim of this study was to identify the potential prognostic factors of local recurrence in patients with colon and rectal cancers. A retrospective review of 1,838 patients who underwent curative resection of non-metastatic colorectal cancer was conducted. The patients were treated between 1994 and 2004, and had a minimum follow-up of 3 years. There were 994 patients with colon cancer and 844 patients with rectal cancer. The median duration of follow-up was 60.9 ± 24.5 months. With respect to colon cancer, the local recurrence rate was 6.1% (61 patients). With respect to rectal cancer, 95 patients had a local recurrence (11.3%), the rate of which was statistically greater than the local recurrence rate for colon cancer (p < 0.001). The overall recurrence rate was 16.4% (301 patients), and the local recurrence rate, with or without systemic metastases, was 8.5% (156 patients). Local recurrences occurred within 2 and 3 years in 59.9% and 82.4% of the patients, respectively. In patients with colon and rectal cancer, the pathologic T stage (p = 0.044 and p = 0.034, respectively), pathologic N stage (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively), and lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.013 and p = 0.004, respectively) were adverse risk factors for local recurrence. The level of the anastomosis from the anal verge was an additional prognostic factor (p = 0.007) in patients with rectal cancer. Compulsive follow-up care of patients with colon and rectal cancers is needed for 3 years after curative resection, especially in patients who have adverse risk factors for local recurrence."

0,"Long-term diuretic therapy in patients with coronary disease: increased colon cancer-related mortality over a 5-year follow-up. Objectives: Recent studies have suggested that long-term diuretic therapy may be associated with increased risk of renal cell carcinoma. This carcinoma is not a common malignancy, but it shares risk factors with the considerably more widespread colon cancer (CC). However, there are no data whether or not a relationship between long-term diuretic therapy and CC mortality exists. In this study we tested the hypothesis that long-term diuretic therapy may be associated with increased CC mortality over a 5.6-year follow-up period. Subjects and methods: The study sample comprised 14 166 patients aged 45 to 74 years with a previous myocardial infarction and/or stable anginal syndrome, screened for participation in the bezafibrate infarction prevention (BIP) study. There were 2153 patients receiving diuretics and 12 013 patients receiving no diuretics. Results: During the follow-up 139 (6.5%) new cases of cancer were diagnosed in the diuretic–treated group compared with 622 (5.2%) in the group receiving no diuretics (P = 0.02). Colon cancer mortality was significantly higher in the diuretic-treated patients (0.1 vs 0.5%, P = 0.001), whereas mortality differences for other cancer types were not documented. Multivariate analysis identified diuretics as an independent predictor of increased colon cancer incidence and colon cancer mortality with a hazard ratio (HR) of 2.0 (95% CI 1.2–3.2) for colon cancer incidence and 3.7 (95% CI 1.7–8.3) for mortality. However, the association between diuretic therapy and higher incidence of colon cancer was observed only among non-users of aspirin. A relatively lower colon cancer incidence was observed in the furosemide subgroup, and higher in the small combined amiloride/hydrochlorthiazide subgroup (HR 3.15, 95% CI 1.15–8.65). Conclusion: Long-term exposure to diuretic therapy may be associated with an increased colon cancer-related mortality."

0,"Circ_0055625 knockdown inhibits tumorigenesis and improves radiosensitivity by regulating miR-338-3p/MSI1 axis in colon cancer. Radiotherapy is a main therapeutic method for cancers, including colon cancer. In the current study, we aim to explore the effects of circular RNA (circRNA) circ_0055625 in the progression and radiosensitivity of colon cancer and the underlying mechanism. The expression of circ_0055625 and musashi homolog 1 (MSI1) mRNA was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). MSI1 protein expression was determined by Western blot. Cell proliferation was assessed by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) and colony formation assays. Cell survival fraction, apoptosis, and invasion were investigated by colony formation assay, flow cytometry analysis, and transwell invasion assay, respectively. Cell migration was detected by wound-healing and transwell migration assays. The binding relationship between microRNA-338-3p (miR-338-3p) and circ_0055625 or MSI1 was predicted by online databases and identified by Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay. The effects of circ_0055625 silencing on the tumor formation and radiosensitivity of colon cancer in vivo were explored by in vivo tumor formation assay. Circ_0055625 and MSI1 were upregulated in colon cancer tissues and cells relative to control groups. Radiation treatment apparently increased the expression of circ_0055625 and MSI1 in colon cancer cells. Circ_0055625 knockdown or MSI1 silencing repressed cell proliferation, migration, and invasion and promoted cell apoptosis and radiosensitivity in colon cancer. Also, circ_0055625 silencing-mediated effects were attenuated by MSI1 overexpression. Additionally, circ_0055625 silencing reduced MSI1 expression, which could be attenuated by miR-338-3p inhibitor. Mechanically, circ_0055625 acted as a sponge for miR-338-3p to regulate MSI1. Furthermore, circ_0055625 knockdown hindered tumor growth and improved radiosensitivity in vivo. Circ_0055625 repression inhibited the progression and radioresistance of colon cancer by downregulating MSI1 through sponging miR-338-3p. This result might provide a theoretical basis for improving the therapy of colon cancer with radiation."
0,"High lactose whey cheese consumption and risk of colorectal cancer - The Norwegian Women and Cancer Study The incidence of colorectal cancer (CRC) has increased among Norwegian women, and is among the highest in the world. In order to understand this increase, country specific dietary exposures have been investigated. The aim of this study was to quantify the association between consumption of brown cheese, a common bread topping in Norway, and colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer in the prospective Norwegian Women and Cancer (NOWAC) Study. Data on brown cheese consumption and adjustment factors was available for 82 527 women. During a mean of 14.6 years of follow-up (1.2 million person-years), there were 1360 cases of colorectal cancer (907 colon; 453 rectal). Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for colorectal, colon, and rectal cancer sites. We modelled restricted cubic splines with 4 knots, to assess a possible non-linear relationship between brown cheese intake and the investigated cancer sites. In the age-adjusted model, consumption of more than 2 slices (>16 grams) of brown cheese per day was associated with 13% reduced risk of colon cancer (95% CI 4%-21%) compared to women who did not consume brown cheese. The multivariable-adjusted model, however, showed no association between brown cheese consumption and the risk of colorectal, colon, or rectal cancer (colorectal: HR = 0.93, 95% CI 0.76–1.13, p-trend 0.37; colon: HR = 0.83, 95% CI 0.65–1.06; p-trend = 0.10; rectal: HR = 1.16, 95% CI 0.84–1.1.61, p-trend = 0.41). In this large, prospective cohort study of women, consumption of brown cheese was suggestively protective against colon cancer. However, adjustment attenuated the inverse risk association. Brown cheese consumption was not associated with rectal cancer, or colorectal cancer overall."

0,"Activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3) functions as a tumor suppressor in colon cancer and is up-regulated upon heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibition Activating transcription factor-3 (ATF3) is involved in the complex process of cellular stress response. However, its exact role in cancer is discussed controversially because both tumor suppressive and oncogenic effects have been described. Here we followed-up on our previous observation that inhibition of Hsp90 may increase ATF3 expression and sought to determine the role of ATF3 in colon cancer. Regulation of ATF3 was determined in cancer cells using signaling inhibitors and a heat-shock protein-90 (Hsp90) antagonist. Human HCT116 cancer cells were stably transfected with an ATF3-shRNA or a luciferase-shRNA expression plasmid and alterations in cell motility were assessed in migration assays. The impact of ATF3 down-regulation on cancer growth and metastasis were investigated in a subcutaneous tumor model, a model of hepatic tumor growth and in a model of peritoneal carcinomatosis. Human colon cancer tissues were analyzed for ATF3 expression. The results show that therapeutic Hsp90 inhibition substantially up-regulates the expression of ATF3 in various cancer cells, including colon, gastric and pancreatic cancer. This effect was evident both in vitro and in vivo. RNAi mediated knock-down of ATF3 in HCT116 colon cancer cells significantly increased cancer cell migration in vitro. Moreover, in xenogenic mouse models, ATF3 knock-down promoted subcutaneous tumor growth and hepatic metastasis, as well as peritoneal carcinomatosis. Importantly, ATF3 expression was lower in human colon cancer specimens, as compared to corresponding normal surrounding tissues, suggesting that ATF3 may represent a down-regulated tumor suppressor in colon cancer. In conclusion, ATF3 down-regulation in colon cancer promotes tumor growth and metastasis. Considering that blocking Hsp90 induces ATF3 expression, Hsp90 inhibition may represent a valid strategy to treat metastatic colon cancer by up-regulating this anti-metastatic transcription factor."
0,"Distribution of colorectal cancer in young African Americans: implications for the choice of screening test. We recently reported on a left-sided predominance of colorectal cancers in the young (under age 50). Given the predilection of young African Americans for the disease, we wondered if there may be a difference in the biology of colorectal carcinogenesis between this group and Caucasians. Compare the distribution of colorectal cancer in African American patients and Caucasians under age 50, and describe implications for screening in these groups. Colorectal cancer patients diagnosed under the age of 50 between the years 2000 and 2016. All races other than African American and Caucasian and all patients with hereditary colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease were excluded. Outcome measures: race, age at diagnosis (5 subgroups: < 20, 20–29, 30–39, 40–44, and 45–49 years) and cancer location; right (cecum, ascending colon, hepatic flexure, transverse colon, splenic flexure), left (descending colon and sigmoid colon), or rectal. 759 patients were included; 695 (91.6%) were Caucasian and 64 (8.4%) were African American. Most cases were diagnosed between ages 40 and 49 (African American = 75%, Caucasian = 69.5%). Rectal cancer was most common in both races, although significantly more common in Caucasian than in African American patients (64.2% vs 39.1%). Right colon cancer was more commonly found in African Americans (37.5%) compared with Caucasians (18%) (p = 0.0002). The ratio of rectal to right-sided colon cancer in African Americans was 1:1 compared with 3.6:1 in Caucasians. Relatively low number of African American patients The high rate of right-sided cancer in young African American patients means that they should be screened with colonoscopy. The increased incidence of right-sided cancers may represent a different biology of carcinogenesis in African Americans and deserves further study."

0,"Identification of the active substances and mechanisms of ginger for the treatment of colon cancer based on network pharmacology and molecular docking Colon cancer is occurring at an increasing rate and ginger (Zingiber officinale), as a commonly used herbal medicine, has been suggested as a potential agent for colon cancer. This study was aimed to identify the bioactive components and potential mechanisms of ginger for colon cancer prevention by an integrated network pharmacology approach. The putative ingredients of ginger and its related targets were discerned from the TCMSP  and Swiss target prediction database. After that, the targets interacting with colon cancer were collected using Genecards, OMIM, and Drugbank databases. KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analysis were performed to explore the signaling pathways related to ginger for colon cancer treatments. The PPI and compound-target-disease networks were constructed using Cytoscape 3.8.1. Finally, Discovery studio software was employed to confirm the key genes and active components from ginger. Six potential active compounds, 285 interacting targets in addition to 1356 disease-related targets were collected, of which 118 intersection targets were obtained. A total of 34 key targets including PIK3CA, SRC, and TP53 were identified through PPI network analysis. These targets were mainly focused on the biological processes of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling, cellular response to oxidative stress, and cellular response to peptide hormone stimulus. The KEGG enrichment manifested that three signaling pathways were closely related to colon cancer prevention of ginger, cancer, endocrine resistance, and hepatitis B pathways. TP53, HSP90AA1, and JAK2 were viewed as the most important genes, which were validated by molecular docking simulation. This study demonstrated that ginger produced preventive effects against colon cancer by regulating multi-targets and multi-pathways with multi-components. And, the combined data provide novel insight for ginger compounds developed as new drug for anti-colon cancer."
0,"Cholesterol reprograms glucose and lipid metabolism to promote proliferation in colon cancer cells. Hypercholesterolemia is often correlated with obesity which is considered a risk factor for various cancers. With the growing population of hypercholesterolemic individuals, there is a need to understand the role of increased circulatory cholesterol or dietary cholesterol intake towards cancer etiology and pathology. Recently, abnormality in the blood cholesterol level of colon cancer patients has been reported. In the present study, we demonstrate that alteration in cholesterol levels (through a high-cholesterol or high-fat diet) increases the incidence of chemical carcinogen-induced colon polyp occurrence and tumor progression in mice. At the cellular level, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) promote colon cancer cell proliferation by tuning the cellular glucose and lipid metabolism. Mechanistically, supplementation of LDLc or HDLc promotes cellular glucose uptake, and utilization, thereby, causing an increase in lactate production by colon cancer cells. Moreover, LDLc or HDLc upregulates aerobic glycolysis, causing an increase in total ATP production through glycolysis, and a decrease in ATP generation by OXPHOS. Interestingly, the shift in the metabolic status towards a more glycolytic phenotype upon the availability of cholesterol supports rapid cell proliferation. Additionally, an alteration in the expression of the molecules involved in cholesterol uptake along with the increase in lipid and cholesterol accumulation was observed in cells supplemented with LDLc or HDLc. These results indicate that colon cancer cells directly utilize the cholesterol associated with LDLc or HDLc. Moreover, targeting glucose metabolism through LDH inhibitor (oxamate) drastically abrogates the cellular proliferation induced by LDLc or HDLc. Collectively, we illustrate the vital role of cholesterol in regulating the cellular glucose and lipid metabolism of cancer cells and its direct effect on the colon tumorigenesis."

0,"Identification of histone methyltransferase NSD2 as an important oncogenic gene in colorectal cancer Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second common cause of cancer-related human mortalities. Dysregulation of histone 3 (H3) methylation could lead to transcriptional activation of multiple oncogenes, which is closely associated with CRC tumorigenesis and progression. Nuclear receptor-binding SET Domain protein 2 (NSD2) is a key histone methyltransferase catalyzing histone H3 lysine 36 dimethylation (H3K36me2). Its expression, the potential functions, and molecular mechanisms in CRC are studied here. Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) bioinformatics results showed that the NSD2 mRNA expression is elevated in both colon cancers and rectal cancers. Furthermore, NSD2 mRNA and protein expression levels in local colon cancer tissues are significantly higher than those in matched surrounding normal tissues. In primary human colon cancer cells and established CRC cell lines, shRNA-induced silencing or CRISPR/Cas9-induced knockout of NSD2 inhibited cell viability, proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration, and invasion. Furthermore, NSD2 shRNA or knockout induced mitochondrial depolarization, DNA damage, and apoptosis in the primary and established CRC cells. Contrarily, ectopic NSD2 overexpression in primary colon cancer cells further enhanced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. H3K36me2, expressions of multiple oncogenes (ADAM9, EGFR, Sox2, Bcl-2, SYK, and MET) and Akt activation were significantly decreased after NSD2 silencing or knockout in primary colon cancer cells. Their levels were however increased after ectopic NSD2 overexpression. A catalytic inactive NSD2 (Y1179A) also inhibited H3K36me2, multiple oncogenes expression, and Akt activation, as well as cell proliferation and migration in primary colon cancer cells. In vivo, intratumoral injection of adeno-associated virus (AAV)-packed NSD2 shRNA largely inhibited primary colon cancer cell xenograft growth in nude mice. Together, NSD2 exerted oncogenic functions in CRC and could be a promising therapeutic target."
0,"Epigallocatechin-3-gallate inhibits the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps and suppresses the migration and invasion of colon cancer cells by regulating STAT3/CXCL8 pathway. Colon cancer is a common malignant tumor of the digestive tract. Tea catechin exerts anti-tumor effects in colon cancer. This work aimed to determine the functions of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), one of the main active components of Tea catechins, in the progression of colon cancer. In this work, enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay, quantitative real-time PCR and western blotting was utilized to examine the levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, STAT3, p-STAT3 and CXCL8 in colon cancer patients and healthy controls. Compared with healthy controls, the levels of IL-1β and TNF-α were significantly increased in the peripheral blood of colon cancer patients, and the expression of STAT3, p-STAT3 and CXCL8 was elevated in the neutrophils derived from colon cancer patients. Moreover, neutrophils were treated with phorbol ester (PMA) or DNase I to induce or impede the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Both STAT3 overexpression and PMA treatment promoted the expression of CXCL8, myeloperoxidase (MPO) and citrullinated histone H3 (H3Cit) in the colon cancer-derived neutrophils, indicating that STAT3 overexpression facilitated the formation of NETs. STAT3 deficiency suppressed the formation of NETs, which consistent with the results of DNase I treatment. Transwell assay was utilized to detect the migration and invasion of colon cancer cell line SW480. EGCG treatment suppressed the formation of NETs and the expression of STAT3 and CXCL8 in the colon cancer-derived neutrophils, and then inhibited the migration and invasion of SW480 cells. In conclusion, this work demonstrated that EGCG inhibited the formation of NETs and subsequent suppressed the migration and invasion of colon cancer cells by regulating STAT3/CXCL8 signalling pathway. Thus, this study suggests that EGCG may become a potential drug for colon cancer therapy."

0,"Correction to: Bazedoxifene as a novel GP130 inhibitor for Colon Cancer therapy. Interleukin-11 (IL-11), a dominant IL-6 family cytokine, is involved in tumorigenesis, tumor progression and differentiation in colon cancer cells. IL-11 signaling has been recently identified as a potential therapeutic target in colon cancer. Bazedoxifene, a third- generation selective estrogen modulator approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), is a novel inhibitor of IL-11/GP130 signaling discovered by docking modeling. In this study, the inhibition efficacy of bazedoxifene in colon cancer cells and its potential mechanism were investigated in vitro and in vivo by using MTT cell viability assay, BrdU cell proliferation assay, colony formation assay, wound-healing/cell migration assay, immunofluorescence, western blot assay and the mouse xenograft tumor model. Bazedoxifene inhibits phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (p-STAT3) and its nuclear translocation induced by IL-11 in colon cancer cells. It also inhibits p-STAT3 induced by IL-6 and IL-11 but not by OSM or STAT1 phosphorylation induced by INF-γ in human colon cancer cells. In addition, bazedoxifene can significantly inhibit phosphorylation of AKT and STAT3 downstream targets. Furthermore, bazedoxifene alone or together with oxaliplatin can significantly induce apoptosis, inhibit cell viability, cell colony formation and cell migration in colon cancer cells. Knock-down of IL-11R can reduce the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to bazedoxifene. IL-11 can reduce the efficacy of oxaliplatin-mediated inhibition of cell viability. Consistent with in vitro findings, bazedoxifene alone also attenuated HCT-15 xenograft tumor burden and reduced p-STAT3, p-AKT and p-ERK in vivo. Its combination with oxaliplatin attenuated DLD-1 xenograft tumor burden and reduced p-STAT3 in vivo. Taken together, these results support bazedoxifene as a novel and effective therapeutic agent targeting IL-11/GP130 signaling for human colorectal cancer therapy."

0,"Targeting SERT promotes tryptophan metabolism: mechanisms and implications in colon cancer treatment. Serotonin signaling has been associated with tumorigenesis and tumor progression. Targeting the serotonin transporter to block serotonin cellular uptake confers antineoplastic effects in various tumors, including colon cancer. However, the antineoplastic mechanism of serotonin transporter inhibition and serotonin metabolism alterations in the absence of serotonin transporter have not been elucidated, especially in colon cancer, which might limit anti-tumor effects associating with targeting serotonin transporter. The promotion in the uptake and catabolism of extracellular tryptophan and targeting serotonin transporter was detected by using quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Western blotting Immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence was utilized to research the serotonylation of mTOR by serotonin and serotonin transporter inhibition. The primary mouse model, homograft model and tissue microarry was used to explore the tryptophan pathway in colon cancer. The cell viability assay, western blotting, xenograft and primary colon cancer mouse model were used to identify whether the combination of sertraline and tryptophan restriction had a synergistic effect. Targeting serotonin transporter through genetic ablation or pharmacological inhibition in vitro and in vivo induced a compensatory effect by promoting the uptake and catabolism of extracellular tryptophan in colon cancer. Mechanistically, targeting serotonin transporter suppressed mTOR serotonylation, leading to mTOR inactivation and increased tryptophan uptake. In turn, this process promoted serotonin biosynthesis and oncogenic metabolite kynurenine production through enhanced tryptophan catabolism. Tryptophan deprivation, or blocking its uptake by using trametinib, a MEK inhibitor, can sensitize colon cancer to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. The present study elucidated a novel feedback mechanism involved in the regulation of serotonin homeostasis and suggested innovative strategies for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors-based treatment of colon cancer."
0,"PADI3 plays an antitumor role via the Hsp90/CKS1 pathway in colon cancer. CKS1 is highly expressed in colon cancer tissues, and is essential for cancer cell proliferation. The downstream molecular mechanism of CKS1 has been fully studied, but the upstream regulatory mechanism of it is still unclear. Earlier research found that PADI3 plays its anti-tumor roles via suppress cell proliferation, in this study, we found that the expression pattern of PADI3 and CKS1 are negatively correlated in colon cancer tissues, and overexpression of PADI3 can partly reverse CKS1 induced cancer cell proliferation. However, the regulatory mechanism of PADI3 and CKS1 in the tumorigenesis of colon cancer is still unclear and need to do further research. Western blot and real-time PCR were used to detect the expression levels of genes. CCK-8 and colony formation assays were used to examine cell proliferation and colony formation ability. Overexpression and rescue experiments were used to study the molecular mechanism of CKS1 in colon cancer cells, BALB/c nude mice were used to study the function of CKS1 in vivo. CKS1 is highly expressed in colon cancer tissues, and the overexpression of CKS1 promotes cell proliferation and colony formation in both HCT116 (originating from primary colon cancer) and SW620 (originating from metastatic tumor nodules of colon cancer) cells. CKS1-expressing HCT116 cells produced larger tumors than the control cells. The expression pattern of PADI3 and CKS1 are negatively correlation in clinical samples of colon cancer, further study indicates that PADI3 can significantly decrease Hsp90 and CKS1 expression, and Hsp90 is essential for PADI3 to downregulate CKS1expression in colon cancer cells. PADI3 exerts its antitumor activity by inhibiting Hsp90 and CKS1 expression, and Hsp90 is essential for PADI3 to suppress CKS1 expression."

0,"Inhibition of TRPM7 suppresses cell proliferation of colon adenocarcinoma in vitro and induces hypomagnesemia in vivo without affecting azoxymethane-induced early colon cancer in mice Magnesium (Mg2+) is an essential cation implicated in carcinogenesis, solid tumor progression and metastatic potential. The Transient Receptor Potential Melastatin Member 7 (TRPM7) is a divalent ion channel involved in cellular and systemic Mg2+ homeostasis. Abnormal expression of TRPM7 is found in numerous cancers, including colon, implicating TRPM7 in this process. To establish a possible link between systemic magnesium (Mg2+) status, the Mg2+ conducting channel TRPM7 in colon epithelial cells, and colon carcinogenesis, in vitro whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology, qPCR, and pharmacological tools were used probing human colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 as well as normal primary mouse colon epithelial cells. This was extended to and combined with aberrant crypt foci development in an azoxymethane-induced colorectal cancer mouse model under hypomagnesemia induced by diet or pharmacologic intervention. We find that TRPM7 drives colon cancer cell proliferation in human HT-29 and expresses in normal primary mouse colon epithelia. This is linked to TRPM7’s dominant role as Mg2+ transporter, since high extracellular Mg2+ supplementation cannot rescue inhibition of cell proliferation caused by suppressing TRPM7 either genetically or pharmacologically. In vivo experiments in mice provide evidence that the specific TRPM7 inhibitor waixenicin A, given as a single bolus injection, induces transient hypomagnesemia and increases intestinal absorption of calcium. Repeated injections of waixenicin A over 3 weeks cause hypomagnesemia via insufficient Mg2+ absorption by the colon. However, neither waixenicin A, nor a diet low in Mg2+, affect aberrant crypt foci development in an azoxymethane-induced colorectal cancer mouse model. Early stage colon cancer proceeds independent of systemic Mg2+ status and TRPM7, and waixenicin A is a useful pharmacological tool to study of TRPM7 in vitro and in vivo."
0,"Down-regulation of malignant potential by alpha linolenic acid in human and mouse colon cancer cells. Omega-3 fatty acids (also called ω-3 fatty acis or n-3 fatty acid) are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) with a double bond (C=C) at the third carbon atom from the end of the carbon chain. Numerous test tube and animal studies have shown that omega-3 fatty acids may prevent or inhibit the growth of cancers, suggesting that omega-3 fatty acids are important in cancer physiology. Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is one of an essential omega-3 fatty acid and organic compound found in seeds (chia and flaxseed), nuts (notably walnuts), and many common vegetable oils. ALA has also been shown to down-regulate cell proliferation of prostate, breast, and bladder cancer cells. However, direct evidence that ALA suppresses to the development of colon cancer has not been studied. Also, no previous studies have evaluated whether ALA may regulate malignant potential (adhesion, invasion and colony formation) in colon cancer cells. In order to address the questions above, we conducted in vitro studies and evaluated whether ALA may down-regulate malignant potential in human (HT29 and HCT116) and mouse (MCA38) colon cancer cell lines. We observed that treatment with 1–5 mM of ALA inhibits cell proliferation, adhesion and invasion in both human and mouse colon cancer cell lines. Interestingly, we observed that ALA did not decrease total colony numbers when compared to control. By contrast, we found that size of colony was significantly changed by ALA treatment when compared to control in all colon cancer cell lines. We suggest that our data enhance our current knowledge of ALA’s mechanism and provide crucial information to further the development of new therapies for the management or chemoprevention of colon cancer."
0,"Association of sedentary behaviour with colon and rectal cancer: a meta-analysis of observational studies. Sedentary behaviour is ubiquitous in modern society. Emerging studies have focused on the health consequences of sedentary behaviour, including colorectal cancer, but whether sedentary behaviour is associated with the risks of colon and rectal cancer remains unclear. No systematic reviews have applied quantitative techniques to independently compute summary risk estimates. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis to investigate this issue. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar databases up to May 2013 to identify cohort and case–control studies that evaluated the association between sedentary behaviour and colon or rectal cancer. A random-effect model was used to pool the results of included studies. Publication bias was assessed by using Begg’s funnel plot. Twenty-three studies with 63 reports were included in our meta-analysis. These groups included 4 324 462 participants (27 231 colon cancer cases and 13 813 rectal cancer cases). Sedentary behaviour was significantly associated with colon cancer (relative risk (RR): 1.30, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22–1.39) but did not have a statistically significant association with rectal cancer (RR 1.05, 95% CI, 0.98–1.13). Subgroup analyses suggested that the odds ratio (OR) of colon cancer was 1.46 (95% CI: 1.22–1.68) in the case–control studies, and the RR was 1.27 (95% CI: 1.18–1.36) in the cohort studies, the OR of rectal cancer was 1.06 (95% CI: 0.85–1.33) in the case–control studies, and the RR was 1.06 (95% CI, 1.01–1.12) in the cohort studies. Sedentary behaviour is associated with an increased risk of colon cancer. Subgroup analyses suggest a positive association between sedentary behaviour and risk of rectal cancer in cohort studies. Reducing sedentary behaviour is potentially important for the prevention of colorectal cancer."
0,"Expression of miR-34 is lost in colon cancer which can be re-expressed by a novel agent CDF Background: Colorectal Cancer (CRC) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Numerous cellular events, including deregulated expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), specifically the family of miR-34 consisting of miR-34a, b and c, is known to regulate the processes of growth and metastasis. Methods: We evaluated the expression of miR-34 in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human colon cancer tissue specimens compared to normal colonic mucosa. Moreover, we also assessed the expression of miR-34 in colon cancer cell lines treated with our newly developed synthetic analogue of curcumin referred as difluorinated curcumin (CDF) compared to well known inhibitor of methyl transferase. Results: We found that the expression of miR-34a and miR-34c was down-regulated in colon cancer specimens compared to normal colonic mucosa and the loss of expression was also consistent with data from colon cancer cell lines. This down-regulation was attributed to promoter hypermethylation, because we found that the treatment of colon cancer cells with 5-aza-2´-deoxycytidine, a methyltransferase inhibitor, markedly induced the levels of miR-34a and miR-34c expression. Likewise, CDF was very effective in the re-expression of miR-34a and miR-34c, which was consistent with inhibition of cell growth of both chemo-sensitive and chemo-resistant colon cancer cells. The re-expression of miR-34 led to a marked reduction in the expression of its target gene, Notch-1. Conclusion: The loss of expression of miR-34 in colon cancer is in part due to promoter hypermethylation of miR-34, which can be re-expressed with our novel agent CDF, suggesting that CDF could be a novel demethylating agent for restoring the expression of miR-34 family, and thus CDF could become a newer therapeutic agent for the treatment of colon cancer."

0,"ERRα suppression enhances the cytotoxicity of the MEK inhibitor trametinib against colon cancer cells. ERRα, a constitutive transcription factor that regulates energy metabolism, plays an important role in the progression of various tumours. However, its role in cell survival and proliferation and its implication in targeted therapy in colon cancer remains elusive. The expression of ERRα in colon cancer tissues and cell lines was detected by using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. A wound healing assay and a transwell assay were performed to examine the migration and invasion of the colon cancer cells. A cell viability assay, clonogenic assay, western blot assay and the dual-luciferase reporter assay were employed to study the interaction between trametinib (inhibitor of MEK) and EGF treatment. Flow cytometry, western blotting, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and xenograft studies were used to identify whether the combination of trametinib and simvastatin had a synergistic effect. ERRα positively regulated the cell proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells, and the suppression of ERRα completely reduced the EGF treatment-induced proliferation of colon cancer cells. Further investigation showed that trametinib partially restrained the up-regulation of ERRα induced by the EGF treatment, and ERRα inhibition increased the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to trametinib. At last, we combined trametinib with simvastatin, a common clinically used drug with a new reported function of transcriptional activity inhibition of ERRα, and found that this combination produced a synergistic effect in inhibiting the proliferation and survival of colon cancer cells in vitro as well as in vivo. The present data indicated that ERRα acted as an oncogene in colon cancer cells, and the combined targeting of ERRα and MEK might be a promising therapeutic strategy for colon cancer treatment."
0,"Association of chemotherapy with survival in stage II colon cancer patients who received radical surgery: a retrospective cohort study. It remains controversial whether patients with Stage II colon cancer would benefit from chemotherapy after radical surgery. This study aims to assess the real effectiveness of chemotherapy in patients with stage II colon cancer undergoing radical surgery and to construct survival prediction models to predict the survival benefits of chemotherapy. Data for stage II colon cancer patients with radical surgery were retrieved from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Propensity score matching (1:1) was performed according to receive or not receive chemotherapy. Competitive risk regression models were used to assess colon cancer cause-specific death (CSD) and non-colon cancer cause-specific death (NCSD). Survival prediction nomograms were constructed to predict overall survival (OS) and colon cancer cause-specific survival (CSS). The predictive abilities of the constructed models were evaluated by the concordance indexes (C-indexes) and calibration curves. A total of 25,110 patients were identified, 21.7% received chemotherapy, and 78.3% were without chemotherapy. A total of 10,916 patients were extracted after propensity score matching. The estimated 3-year overall survival rates of chemotherapy were 0.7% higher than non- chemotherapy. The estimated 5-year and 10-year overall survival rates of non-chemotherapy were 1.3 and 2.1% higher than chemotherapy, respectively. Survival prediction models showed good discrimination (the C-indexes between 0.582 and 0.757) and excellent calibration. Chemotherapy improves the short-term (43 months) survival benefit of stage II colon cancer patients who received radical surgery. Survival prediction models can be used to predict OS and CSS of patients receiving chemotherapy as well as OS and CSS of patients not receiving chemotherapy and to make individualized treatment recommendations for stage II colon cancer patients who received radical surgery."

Protein regulator of cytokinesis 1 (PRC1) has been reported to play important role in the pathogenesis of various cancers. However, its role in colon cancer has not been studied. Here, we aimed to investigate the biological functions and potential mechanism of PRC1 in colon cancer. The expression level of PRC1 in colon cancer tissues and cell lines was detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of a tissue microarray (TMA). Furthermore, colon cancer cell lines HCT116 and SW480 were treated with short hairpin RNAs against PRC1. The biological function of PRC1 was determined by MTT proliferation, colony formation assay, cell cycle, and apoptosis assays. Then, an in vivo tumor formation assay was conducted to explore the effects of PRC1 on tumor growth. The mRNA and protein expression levels of PRC1 were highly expressed in colon cancer tissues and cell lines. PRC1 expression was associated with clinicopathological characteristics and overall survival of patients with colon cancer. Knockdown of PRC1 could decrease proliferation and colony forming ability of colon cancer cells, as well as arrested more cells at G2/M phase and promoted cell apoptosis. In cancer cells, the expression pattern of protein regulators included in cell cycle and apoptosis progress were reverted by PRC1 down-regulation. Additionally, PRC1 down-regulation could suppress colon tumor growth and differentiation. We confirmed that PRC1 was overexpressed in colon cancer and was associated with poor prognosis of colon cancer patients. PRC1 down-regulation could arrest cell cycle at G2/M stage, inhibit proliferation, and elicit apoptosis. These findings showed the potential of PRC1 to be used for therapeutic approaches in colon cancer."
0,"Study on effects of miR-141-3p in proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis of colon cancer cells by inhibiting Bcl2 This study aimed to investigate the relationship between miR-141-3p and B lymphocyte-2 gene (Bcl2) gene and its biological behavior on colon cancer cell line SW480. qRT-PCR was used to detect the expression level of miR-141-3p in colon cancer tissues and adjacent tissues, as well as in colon cancer cell line and normal human colonic epithelial cell line FHC. MTT assay, wound assay, and Transwell demonstrated the effects of miR-141-3p on colon cancer proliferation, migration and invasion. Targetscan7.1 predictive software and dual luciferase reporter assays were used to detect the targeted regulation of miR-141-3p on the apoptosis-related gene Bcl2. MTT assay, wound assay, Transwell and flow cytometry were used to detect the effect of Bcl2 on miR-141-3p on colon cancer proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis. Compared with adjacent tissues, the expression of miR-141-3p in colon cancer tissues was significantly down-regulated. Colon cancer patients with low expression of miR-141-3p had poorer prognosis. Compared with normal colonic epithelial cells, miR-141-3p expression was significantly down-regulated in colon cancer cell lines, and overexpression of miR-141-3p significantly attenuated the proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells. Knockdown of miR-141-3p significantly promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells. miR-141-3p targets the negative regulation of Bcl2. Knockdown of Bcl2 significantly attenuated the promotion of miR-141-3p inhibitor on proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells and inhibition of apoptosis. Knockdown of Bcl2 significantly enhanced the inhibition effect of miR-141-3p inhibitor on proliferation, migration and invasion of colon cancer cells. In conclusion, miR-141-3p can inhibit the cancer by regulating Bcl2, and miR-141-3p has the potential to become a potential therapeutic target for colon cancer."
0,"Curcumin inhibits human colon cancer cell growth by suppressing gene expression of epidermal growth factor receptor through reducing the activity of the transcription factor Egr-1. High expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is found in a variety of solid tumors, including colorectal cancer. EGFR has been identified as a rational target for anticancer therapy. Curcumin, the yellow pigment of turmeric in curry, has received attention as a promising dietary supplement for cancer prevention and treatment. We recently reported that curcumin inhibited the growth of human colon cancer-derived Moser cells by suppressing gene expression of cyclinD1 and EGFR. The aim of the present study was to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying curcumin inhibition of gene expression of EGFR in colon cancer cells. The generality of the inhibitory effect of curcumin on gene expression of EGFR was verified in other human colon cancer-derived cell lines, including Caco-2 and HT-29 cells. Promoter deletion assays and site-directed mutageneses identified a binding site for the transcription factor early growth response-1 (Egr-1) in egfr promoter as a putative curcumin response element in regulating the promoter activity of the gene in Moser cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that curcumin significantly reduced the DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor Egr-1 to the curcumin response element. In addition, curcumin reduced the trans-activation activity of Egr-1 by suppressing egr-1 gene expression, which required interruption of the ERK signal pathway and reduction of the level of phosphorylation of Elk-1 and its activity. Taken together, our results demonstrated that curcumin inhibited human colon cancer cell growth by suppressing gene expression of EGFR through reducing the trans-activation activity of Egr-1. These results provided novel insights into the mechanisms of curcumin inhibition of colon cancer cell growth and potential therapeutic strategies for treatment of colon cancer."
0,"Prognostic impact of primary tumor location in Stage III colorectal cancer-right-sided colon versus left-sided colon versus rectum: a nationwide multicenter retrospective study Previous studies investigating the impact of tumor location on colorectal cancer prognosis only compared two groups by location, e.g., ‘right-sided colon vs. left-sided colon,’ ‘colon vs. rectum,’ and ‘right-sided (right-sided colon) vs. left-sided (left-sided colon and rectum).’ This nationwide multicenter retrospective study aimed to clarify the prognostic impact of tumor location in patients with stage III colorectal cancer by classifying tumors into three groups: right-sided colon, left-sided colon, and rectum. Subjects were 9194 patients with stage III colorectal cancer who underwent curative surgery from 1997 to 2012. Relapse-free survival (RFS) after primary surgery and overall survival (OS) after recurrence were examined.;  Rectal cancer (n = 2922) was associated with worse RFS compared to right-sided colon cancer (n = 2362) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.65; 95% CI 0.59–0.72; p < 0.001) and left-sided colon cancer (n = 3910) (HR 0.72; 95% CI 0.66–0.78; p < 0.001) after adjusting for key clinical factors (i.e., sex, age, histological type, CEA, adjuvant therapy, T category, and N category). Among patients with recurrence (n = 2823), rectal cancer was associated with better OS compared to right-sided colon cancer (HR 1.23; 95% CI 1.08–1.40; p = 0.002) and worse OS compared to left-sided colon cancer (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.79–0.99; p = 0.029). Twenty percent of right-sided colon cancer recurrences exhibited peritoneal dissemination, 42% of left-sided colon cancer recurrences were liver metastases, and 33% of rectal cancer recurrences were local recurrences. The three tumor locations (right-sided colon, left-sided colon, rectum) had different prognostic implications for recurrence after curative resection and overall mortality, suggesting that tumor location serves as a prognostic biomarker in stage III colorectal cancer."
0,"Oncological outcomes of robotic-assisted laparoscopic versus open lateral lymph node dissection for locally advanced low rectal cancer The long-term outcomes of robotic-assisted laparoscopic lateral lymph node dissection (RALLD) have not been fully investigated. This study aimed to assess the oncological and long-term outcomes of RALLD for rectal cancer through comparison with those of open lateral lymph node dissection (OLLD) in a retrospective study. Between September 2002 and October 2014, the medical data of 426 patients who underwent total mesorectal excision with lateral lymph node dissection for primary rectal cancer were collected. Of these, 115 patients were excluded after data collection (stage IV, n = 61; total pelvic exenteration, n = 31; multiple cancer, n = 20; conventional laparoscopic surgery, n = 3). Before matching, 311 patients with clinical stage II/III were analyzed. Using exact matching, patients were stratified into RALLD (n = 78) and OLLD (n = 78) groups. Pathological findings and long-term outcomes were compared between the groups. The pathological stage and number of harvested lymph nodes showed no significant differences between the groups. The rate of positive resection margin in the RALLD group tended to be lower compared with that of the OLLD group (p = 0.059). The median follow-up duration was 54.0 months in 156 patients. The 5-year overall survival rate was 95.4 and 87.8% in the RALLD and OLLD groups, respectively (p = 0.106). The 5-year relapse-free survival rate was 79.1 and 69.9% in the RALLD and OLLD groups, respectively (p = 0.157). The 5-year local relapse-free survival rate was 98.6 and 90.9% in the RALLD and OLLD groups, respectively (p = 0.029). The short- and long-term outcomes indicated that RALLD may be a useful modality for locally advanced low rectal cancer."
0,"Fibroblast-derived CXCL12 regulates PTEN expression and is associated with the proliferation and invasion of colon cancer cells via PI3k/Akt signaling Stromal-derived CXCL12 play an important role which influence the proliferation and invasiveness of colon cancer in microenvironment. The present study aimed to analyze the underlying mechanism by which CXCL12 and tumour suppressor protein phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) influences the metastatic potential of colon cancer and internal relation of colon cancer and stromal cells. RT-PCR and western blot were detected the expression of CXCL12, CXCR4 and PTEN in colon cancer cells and stromal cells. The co-operative effects of CXCL12 and PTEN on proliferation and invasion of colon cancer cells were evaluated by real-time PCR, proliferation and invasion assays using an in vitro system consisting of co-cultured cancer cells and stromal cells. We eventually investigated activation of PI3K/Akt signaling by CXCL12 regulate PTEN and involved in the metastatic process of colon cancer. In addition, we also examine how the knockdown of PTEN influences proliferation and invasion and correlate with CXCL12/CXCR4/PI3K/Akt, determination of PTEN up-down-stream targets that preferentially contribute to tumorigenesis. Blockage of PTEN phosphorylation led to a stronger enhancement of cell proliferation and invasion upon stimulation with CXCL12 via its activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, knockdown of PTEN by siRNA transfection was also found to enhance the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway, thereby promoting cell invasion and proliferation. CXCL12 induced transcriptional down-regulation of activated PTEN and this signaling pathway promotes cell survival. CXCL12/CXCR4/PI3K/Akt cascade may be critical for colon cancer cells to metastasize. Based on our results, we suggest that the modification of CXCR4, PTEN, or PI3K function might be promising new therapeutic approaches to inhibit the aggressive spread of colon cancer."
0,"Exploring mechanisms of diet-colon cancer associations through candidate molecular interaction networks Background: Epidemiological studies in the recent years have investigated the relationship between dietary habits and disease risk demonstrating that diet has a direct effect on public health. Especially plant-based diets -fruits, vegetables and herbs- are known as a source of molecules with pharmacological properties for treatment of several malignancies. Unquestionably, for developing specific intervention strategies to reduce cancer risk there is a need for a more extensive and holistic examination of the dietary components for exploring the mechanisms of action and understanding the nutrient-nutrient interactions. Here, we used colon cancer as a proof-of-concept for understanding key regulatory sites of diet on the disease pathway. Results: We started from a unique vantage point by having a database of 158 plants positively associated to colon cancer reduction and their molecular composition (~3,500 unique compounds). We generated a comprehensive picture of the interaction profile of these edible and non-edible plants with a predefined candidate colon cancer target space consisting of ~1,900 proteins. This knowledge allowed us to study systematically the key components in colon cancer that are targeted synergistically by phytochemicals and identify statistically significant and highly correlated protein networks that could be perturbed by dietary habits. Conclusion: We propose here a framework for interrogating the critical targets in colon cancer processes and identifying plant-based dietary interventions as important modifiers using a systems chemical biology approach. Our methodology for better delineating prevention of colon cancer by nutritional interventions relies heavily on the availability of information about the small molecule constituents of our diet and it can be expanded to any other disease class that previous evidence has linked to lifestyle."

0,"Extra-luminal detection of assumed colonic tumor site by near-infrared laparoscopy. Localization of colorectal tumors during laparoscopic surgery is generally performed by tattooing into the submucosal layer of the colon. However, faint and diffuse tattoos may lead to difficulties in recognizing cancer sites, resulting in inappropriate resection of the colon. We previously demonstrated that yttrium oxide nanoparticles doped with the rare earth ions (ytterbium and erbium) (YNP) showed strong near-infrared (NIR) emission under NIR excitation (1550 nm emission with 980 nm excitation). NIR light can penetrate deep tissues. In this study, we developed an NIR laparoscopy imaging system and demonstrated its use for accurate resection of the colon in swine. The NIR laparoscopy system consisted of an NIR laparoscope, NIR excitation laser diode, and an NIR camera. Endo-clips coated with YNP (NIR clip), silicon rubber including YNP (NIR silicon mass), and YNP solution (NIR ink) were prepared as test NIR markers. We used a swine model to detect an assumed colon cancer site using NIR laparoscopy, followed by laparoscopic resection. The NIR markers were fixed at an assumed cancer site within the colon by endoscopy. An NIR laparoscope was then introduced into the abdominal cavity through a laparoscopy port. NIR emission from the markers in the swine colon was successfully recognized using the NIR laparoscopy imaging system. The position of the markers in the colon could be identified. Accurate resection of the colon was performed successfully by laparoscopic surgery under NIR fluorescence guidance. The presence of the NIR markers within the extirpated colon was confirmed, indicating resection of the appropriate site. NIR laparoscopic surgery is useful for colorectal cancer site recognition and accurate resection using laparoscopic surgery."
0,"Proportion of colon cancer attributable to lifestyle in a cohort of US women Many modifiable lifestyle factors have been associated with colon cancer risk, but less is known about their effect on disease when considered together. Estimating the proportion of colon cancer cases that could be prevented by the adoption of combined modifiable lifestyle behaviors will provide important insights into disease prevention. In the Nurses’ Health Study, we defined a low-risk group according to a combination of six factors: body mass index <25 kg/m2, physical activity of ≥21 metabolic equivalent of task per week, alcohol consumption ≤30 g/day, cigarette smoking <10 pack-years before the age of 30, current use of multivitamins for ≥15 years, and total calcium intake ≥700 mg/day. A composite risk score index was created and the population attributable risk (PAR%) was calculated after accounting for other known risk or protective factors. We documented 1,127 colon cancer cases among 81,092 over 24 years of follow-up. Compared with women in the lowest risk category, the women at all other exposure levels had a hazard ratio of colon cancer of 1.81 (95 % confidence interval 1.15–2.85). The score index was significantly and linearly related to an increasing risk of colon cancer (p value for trend <0.0001). The PAR% of the six risk factors considered together in relation to colon cancer was 0.37 (95 % CI 0.09–0.60). When regular aspirin use (two tablets/week for six or more years) was included with the other low-risk behaviors, the PAR% increased to 0.43 (95 % CI 0.14–0.65). Beyond the known benefit from colonoscopy/sigmoidoscopy, key behavior modifications and adherence to a healthy lifestyle could avoid approximately 37 % of colon cancer cases among women."
0,"Comparison of Characteristics and Inpatient Outcomes of Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Colon Cancer: A Propensity-Based Nationwide Inpatient Sample Study. Introduction Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) frequently develop colon cancer. Previous studies have identified the association between IBD and colon cancer. In this study, we explored the characteristics and outcomes of IBD patients with colon cancer admitted to the hospitals of the United States. Methods Patients who were hospitalized patients with diagnoses of IBD and colon cancer were compared with patients with IBD without colon cancer. The data were extracted from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) from January 2016 to December 2017. Comparisons were made with regards to mortality, complications, in-hospital stay, and cost of treatment between the two groups. Results We identified 1,82,025 hospitalizations from January 2016 to December 2017 admitted with a diagnosis of IBD. Of these, 181,560 patients had IBD without colon cancer, and 465 patients had IBD with colon cancer. No statistically significant difference was observed with regards to the in-hospital mortality between the two groups. There were higher odds of acute kidney injury (AKI) (OR 1.54, 95% CI 6.6-9.8; p=0.00), colectomy (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.3-2.5; p=0.0) and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB) (OR 1.6, 95% CI 1.8-3.7; p=0.04) in patients with IBD and colon cancer. A longer length of stay (7.1±6.9 vs.5.0±5.6, p=0.00) and higher mean total charge ($20,283 vs. $12,166, p=0.00) were observed in patients with IBD with colon cancer. Conclusions Patients with IBD-associated colon cancer appear to have higher complication rates, higher costs, and more extended hospital stays. Therefore, early identification and management of complications related to IBD among patients with colon cancer are particularly crucial to reduce morbidity as well as the cost of hospitalization and treatment."
0,"Aspirin inhibited the metastasis of colon cancer cells by inhibiting the expression of toll-like receptor 4 The metastasis of colorectal cancer frequently tends to liver, which is one of the three leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Growing evidence showed that aspirin could effectively inhibit liver metastasis of colorectal cancer. However, the potential mechanism has not been fully understood. Mouse splenic vein metastasis assay was used to examine the metastatic ability of colon cancer cells in vivo. And wound healing and transwell assay were applied to detect the metastasis potential of C26 and HCT116 colon cancer cell lines in vitro. RT-PCR and western blotting were used to explore Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression in colon cancer cell lines. The functions of TLR4 in the migration of the colon cancer cell line were analyzed by infecting cells with lentivirus containing TLR4 siRNA. We demonstrated that lipopolysaccharides (LPS) could enhance the metastasis potential of C26 and HCT116 colon cancer cell lines. However, aspirin effectively decreased the metastasis capacity of colon cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. We found that the enhancement of LPS on the migration of colon cancer cells by inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype demonstrated a TLR4-dependent manner. Aspirin treatment lead to the downregulation of TLR4 on C26 cells which resulted in the decrease of C26 cells migration and EMT phenotype that induced by LPS. Additionally, the inhibitory effect from aspirin on the expression of TLR4 on C26 cells leads to the downregulation of NF-κB. The results of our study indicate that LPS origin from intestinal flora may promote the metastasis of colon cancer to liver and aspirin may inhibit the metastasis of colon cancer by inhibiting the expression of TLR4."

0,"MicroRNA miR-29a Inhibits Colon Cancer Progression by Downregulating B7-H3 Expression: Potential Molecular Targets for Colon Cancer Therapy. MiR-29a belongs to one of the subtypes of miRNAs known as non-coding single-stranded RNAs and is preferentially expressed in normal tissues. B7-H3, a member of the B7/CD28 immunoglobulin superfamily, was shown to be overexpressed in several solid malignant tumors, including colon cancer. In addition, it is associated with tumor progression and poor prognosis. We used immunohistochemical and Western blotting to assess B7-H3 protein expression levels in colon cancer and adjacent normal tissues and then compared their relationships with clinicopathological factors. Quantitative real-time reverse-transcription PCR was used to assess B7-H3 and miRNA-29a mRNA expression levels, and then their relationship and clinical significance were evaluated. In addition, colon cancer Caco-2 cells, which constitutively overexpress B7-H3, were transfected with lentivirus particles for miR-29a upregulation. Invasion and migration assays were carried out in vitro along with the establishment of a subcutaneous xenograft model in vivo to determine the role of miRNA-29a in colon cancer progression. The B7-H3 protein showed elevated expression in colon carcinoma and was relevant to TNM staging, lymph node metastasis, and reduced survival. Meanwhile, miR-29a was preferentially expressed in normal colon tissues, while B7-H3 transcript levels had no marked differences between tumor and normal tissue specimens. In vitro, miR-29a upregulation resulted in reduced B7-H3 expression. Furthermore, miR-29a upregulation reduced the invasive and migratory abilities of colon carcinoma cells. In animal models, upregulation of miR-29a slowed down the growth of subcutaneous xenotransplanted tumors and resulted in prolonged survival time. MiR-29a downregulates B7-H3 expression and accordingly inhibits colon cancer progression, invasion, and migration, indicating miR-29a and B7-H3 might represent novel molecular targets for advanced immunotherapy in colon cancer."
0,"Carcinoma obstruction of the proximal colon cancer and long-term prognosis—obstruction is a predictor of worse outcome in TNM stage II tumor Colon obstruction is suggested to be a predictor of poor outcome in colon cancer. However, the effect of obstruction on outcome in patients with different tumor–nodes–metastases (TNM) stage cancer has not been fully addressed. The aim of this study is to determine whether colon obstruction predicts surgical and long-term oncologic outcomes in patients with proximal colon cancer. A total of 1,492 consecutive patients underwent open resection of primary adenocarcinoma of right colon in a single institution between January 1995 and December 2005. Clinical and follow-up data were extracted from a prospective colorectal cancer database. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify colon obstruction and other predictors of surgical and oncologic outcomes. Among 1,492 patients, 306 (20.5%) patients presented with colon obstruction. The rates of surgical morbidity and mortality were greater in patients with an obstruction as compared to patients without an obstruction (22.2% and 3.9% vs. 14.1% and 1.9%; p = 0.0005 and 0.041, respectively). Obstruction predicted a worse long-term disease-free survival (DFS) among patients with stage II–III disease (log-rank test, p = 0.0003). The data were stratified by TNM stage. Obstruction predicted a worse DFS among patients with TNM stage II cancer (598 patients; log-rank test, p = 0.001; Cox regression, p = 0.012), but it was not a predictor in TNM stage III cancer patients (424 patients; p = 0.116; p = 0.108). Colon obstruction was an independent predictor of long-term outcome only in TNM stage II but not in stage III proximal colon cancer. Patients with TNM stage II obstructive colon cancer could be included in future trials of adjuvant therapies."
0,"Postoperative intra-abdominal infection is an independent prognostic factor of disease-free survival and disease-specific survival in patients with stage II colon cancer Recurrence occurs in up to 20% of patients with stage II colon cancer operated on for cure. Although postoperative intra-abdominal infection has been linked with an increased risk of recurrence, the association is controversial. The aim was to investigate the impact of postoperative intra-abdominal infection on disease-free survival and disease-specific survival in patients with stage II colon cancer. Patients undergoing elective surgery for colon cancer stage II, between 2003 and 2014, were included. Patients with anastomotic leak or intra-abdominal abscess were included in the infection group. We used the Kaplan–Meier method to represent the distribution of survival and the Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the contribution of relevant clinicopathological factors with prognosis. Postoperative intra-abdominal infection was diagnosed in 37 of 363 (10.2%) patients. Perioperative blood transfusion was more frequent in patients with infection (p = 0.008). Overall 5-year disease-free survival rate was 85.1%. Disease-free survival at 5 years was lower in patients with postoperative intra-abdominal infection (52.8 vs 88.7%; p < 0.001), perineural invasion (p = 0.001), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.001), pT4 (p = 0.013), and in patients with adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.013). Multivariate analysis showed that postoperative intra-abdominal infection (HR 4.275; p < 0.001), perineural invasion (HR 2.230; p = 0.007), and lymphovascular invasion (HR 2.052; p = 0.016) were all significant independent predictors of reduced disease-free survival. Regarding specific survival, independent significant prognostic factors were the number of lymph nodes, lymphovascular invasion, and postoperative intra-abdominal infection. In this series of patients with stage II colon cancer, postoperative intra-abdominal infection has an independent negative impact on disease-free survival and disease-specific survival."
0,"High expression of TCN1 is a negative prognostic biomarker and can predict neoadjuvant chemosensitivity of colon cancer. Transcobalamin (TCN1) is a vitamin B12 (cobalamin)-binding protein that regulates cobalamin homeostasis. Recent studies and bioinformatic analyses have found that TCN1 is highly expressed in cancer tissues and is associated with tumour aggressiveness and poor prognosis. The present study aimed to detect TCN1 as a novel biomarker for prognosis and chemosensitivity of colon cancer. Next-generation sequencing showed that TCN1 was one of several upregulated mRNAs in colon cancer, which was verified by further bioinformatics analyses. Western blotting (n = 9) and quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR, n = 30) revealed that TCN1 was highly expressed in colon cancer tissues at both the protein and mRNA level. A total of 194 cases of colon cancer were examined by immunohistochemistry and revealed that TCN1 expression level was related to advanced stages (P < 0.005). Kaplan–Meier analysis verified that patients with lower TCN1 expression usually had longer overall survival (P = 0.008). In addition, TCN1 was highly expressed in pulmonary metastatic tumour tissues (n = 37, P = 0.025) and exhibited higher levels in right-sided colon cancer than in left-sided colon cancer (P = 0.029). TCN1 expression in specimens that had received neoadjuvant chemotherapy decreased compared with that in colonoscopy biopsy tissues (n = 42, P = 0.009). Further bioinformatics analyses verified that apoptosis pathways might have a role in high TCN1 expression. All the studies revealed that TCN1 expression in colon cancer was significantly associated with malignant biological behaviour. Therefore, TCN1 could be used as a novel biomarker for colon cancer aggressiveness and prognosis and might also be a potential biomarker for predicting neoadjuvant chemosensitivity."
0,"Inhibition of haematogenous metastasis of colon cancer in mice by a selective COX-2 inhibitor, JTE-522. It is proposed that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) reduce colorectal tumorigenesis by inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). COX is a key enzyme in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins and two isoforms of COX have been characterized, COX-1 and COX-2. Multiple studies have shown that COX-2 is expressed at high levels in colorectal tumours and play a role in colorectal tumorigenesis. Recently it has been reported that selective inhibition of COX-2 inhibits colon cancer cell growth. In this study we investigated the effect of a selective COX-2 inhibitor (JTE-522) on haematogenous metastasis of colon cancer. For this purpose, we selected a murine colon cancer cell line, colon-26, that constitutively expresses the COX-2 protein. The subclone P expressed a high level of COX-2 and the subclone 5 expressed a low level. The colon-26 subclones were injected into the tail vein of BALB/c mice. JTE-522 was given intraperitoneally every day from the day prior to cancer cell injection, and the mice were sacrificed 16 days after cell injection. Lung metastases were compared between groups with and without JTE-522. In the mice injected with subclone P, the number of lung metastatic nodules was significantly reduced in the treated group. However, in the mice injected with subclone 5, there was little difference between the control and the treated groups. These results indicate that there may be a direct link between inhibition of haematogenous metastasis of colon cancer and selective inhibition of COX-2, and that selective COX-2 inhibitors may be a novel class of therapeutic agents not only for colorectal tumorigenesis but also for haematogenous metastasis of colon cancer."

0,"Karyopherin Subunit Alpha 1 Enhances the Malignant Behaviors of Colon Cancer Cells via Promoting Nuclear Factor-κB p65 Nuclear Translocation. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND/AIMS"">Aberrant nuclear factor-κB p65 (NF-κB p65) nuclear import commonly occurs in multiple cancers, including colon cancer. According to BioGRID, we noted that Karyopherin subunit alpha 1 (KPNA1), an important molecular transporter between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, may interact with NF-κB p65. KPNA1 itself is highly expressed in colon adenocarcinoma samples (N = 286) based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. We aimed to explore the role of KPNA1 in colonic carcinogenesis and to determine whether NF-κB p65 nuclear translocation was involved.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">KPNA1 expressions at mRNA and protein levels were analyzed in colon cancer tissues. The regulatory effect of KPNA1 on malignant biological properties was detected in SW480 and HCT116 colon cancer cells. Coimmunoprecipitation and immunofluorescence were performed to verify the relationship between KPNA1 and NF-κB p65. KPNA1 ubiquitination was also preliminarily investigated.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">KPNA1 was firstly confirmed as a significantly upregulated gene in our collected clinical colon cancer samples (N = 35). KPNA1 depletion inhibited cell proliferation, induced cell cycle arrest, and diminished migratory and invasive capacity of SW480 and HCT116 cells. Colon cancer cells overexpressing KPNA1 acquired more aggressive behaviors. KPNA1 acted as a transporter to induce the nuclear accumulation of NF-κB p65, thereby activating NF-κB signaling pathway in colon cancer cells. Furthermore, HECT, C2, and WW Domain-Containing E3 Ubiquitin (HECW2) interacted with KPNA1 to induce its ubiquitination. KPNA1 labeled with polyubiquitins was degraded through ubiquitin-proteasome system.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">The present study uncovers a role of KPNA1-NF-κB p65 axis in promoting colonic carcinogenesis.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2023.

0,"Carcinoma of the splenic flexure: multivariate analysis of predictive factors for clinicopathological characteristics and outcome after surgery. The clinicopathological characteristics and outcome of splenic flexure cancer after surgery have yet to be fully elucidated. The aim of the current study was, therefore, to establish predictive factors related to splenic flexure cancer and outcome after surgery. We compared the clinicopathological characteristics and outcome of 34 patients with splenic flexure cancers (which represents 3.7% of the total number of colon cancers in our series) with those of 418 patients with right colon and 475 patients with left colon cancers by univariate and multivariate analyses, using logistic regression analysis and Cox's proportional hazards model. Splenic flexure cancers had a high risk of obstruction (26.5% of patients), and had a more advanced stage and lower cure rate than left colon cancers. Logistic regression analysis revealed that two independent factors, colonic obstruction and the presence of distant metastases, were related to the splenic flexure tumor site. Splenic flexure cancer patients had a poorer outcome than those with left colon cancer (P = 0.0361). However, there was no difference in survival between patients with splenic flexure, those with right colon cancer and those with left colon cancer who underwent curative surgery. Cox's regression analysis revealed that neither the site of splenic flexure nor colonic obstruction was an independent prognostic factor. In conclusion, splenic flexure cancer is characterized by a high risk of obstruction and the presence of distant metastases. However, after curative resection, splenic flexure cancer has a similar outcome to colon cancer at other sites. In addition, neither the splenic flexure site nor colonic obstruction had an independent influence on patient survival after surgery."
0,"CDX2 expression and perioperative patient serum affects the adhesion properties of cultured colon cancer cells Colon cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed types of cancer with surgical resection of the tumor being the primary choice of treatment. However, the surgical stress response induced during treatment may be related to a higher risk of recurrence. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of surgery on adhesion of cultured colon cancer cells with or without expression of the tumour suppressor CDX2. We enrolled 30 patients undergoing elective, curatively intended laparoscopic surgery for colon cancer in this study. Blood samples were drawn 1 day prior to surgery and 24 h after surgery. The samples of pre- and postoperative serum was applied to wild type colon cancer LS174T cells and CDX2 inducible LS174T cells and adhesion was measured with Real-Time Cell-Analysis iCELLigence using electrical impedance as a readout to monitor changes in the cellular adhesion. Adhesion abilities of wild type LS174T cells seeded in postoperative serum was significantly increased compared to cells seeded in preoperative serum. When seeding the CDX2 inducible LS174T cells without CDX2 expression in pre- and postoperative serum, no significant difference in adhesion was found. However, when inducing CDX2 expression in these cells, the adhesion abilities in pre- and postoperative serum resembled those of the LS174T wild type cell line. We found that the adhesion of colon cancer cells was significantly increased in postoperative versus preoperative serum, and that CDX2 expression affected the adhesive ability of cancer cells. The results of this study may help to elucidate the pro-metastatic mechanisms in the perioperative phase and the role of CDX2 in colon cancer metastasis."
0,"Colon Cancer Staging: When Does High Resolution MRI Have a Role? Contrarily to what happens with rectal cancer, the role of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the assessment of colon cancer has been limited. However, we may witness a ‘paradigm shift’ in the future. Classically, colon cancer has been assessed by computed tomography (CT) which is considered the workhorse for evaluating this neoplasm as it provides insights not only about local and regional disease as well as about distant metastases. However, as the accuracy of CT is somewhat limited, recent reports about the use of MRI in colon cancers have been published. In this review we will assess the potential role of MRI in the setting of colon cancer, with particular emphasis on primary staging. Overall, MRI seems to offer the potential to distinguish between locally advanced and not locally advanced colon cancers. High resolution MRI may have an advantage in comparison to other techniques – namely CT – related to its high soft tissue discrimination. MRI can, in most studies, identify prognostic factors such as T-stage and extramural venous invasion. However, nodal characterization by MRI has some drawbacks that have a negative impact on the accuracy of the technique. Current evidence about the role of MRI in colon cancer staging is still limited. Although the works published so far offer promising results, the role of this imaging modality is largely dependent on the possible implementation of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for locally advanced colon cancers. In this setting, MRI may be very helpful in selecting patients who can benefit from that therapy. Further research on the field, including large multi-institutional studies, is warranted."
0,"Knockdown of Parkinson's disease-related gene ATP13A2 reduces tumorigenesis via blocking autophagic flux in colon cancer. Accumulating evidence shows that Parkinson’s disease is negatively associated with colon cancer risk, indicating that Parkinson’s disease family proteins may be involved in the initiation of colon cancer. Here, we aimed to identify a Parkinson’s disease-related gene involved in colon cancer, elucidate the underlying mechanisms, and test whether it can be used as a target for cancer therapy. We first screened colon cancer and normal tissues for differential expression of Parkinson’s disease-associated genes and identified ATP13A2, which encodes cation-transporting ATPase 13A2, as a putative marker for colon cancer. We next correlated ATP13A2 expression with colon cancer prognosis. We performed a series of ATP13A2 knockdown and overexpression studies in vitro to identify the contribution of ATP13A2 in the stemness and invasive capacity of colon cancer cells. Additionally, autophagy flux assay were determined to explore the mechanism of ATP13A2 induced stemness. Finally, we knocked down ATP13A2 in mice using siRNA to determine whether it can be used as target for colon cancer treatment. Colon cancer patients with high ATP13A2 expression exhibit shorter overall survival than those with low ATP13A2. Functionally, ATP13A2 acts as a novel stimulator of stem-like traits. Furthermore, knockdown of ATP13A2 in HCT116 resulted in decreased levels of cellular autophagy. Additionally, bafilomycin A1, an autophagy inhibitor, reversed the ATP13A2-induced stemness of colon cancer cells. Lastly treatment with ATP13A2 siRNA reduced the volume of colon cancer xenografts in mice. The PD-associated gene ATP13A2 is involved in colon cancer stemness through regulation of autophagy. Furthermore, ATP13A2 is a novel prognostic biomarker for colon cancer and is a potential target for colon cancer therapy."

0,"Anti-CHI3L1 antibody suppresses colon cancer growth through downregulation of VEGFA and NAMPT expression. Chitinase 3-like 1 (CHI3L1) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including cancer. In our previous study, we found that anti-CHIL1 antibody inhibited lung tumorigenesis. It has been reported that CHI3L1 is highly overexpressed in colon cancer tissue compared with normal tissue, and high levels of serum CHI3L1 have been associated with worse colon cancer prognosis. We investigated the anticancer effect of an anti-CHI3L1 antibody on colon cancer cells. The anti-CHI3L1 antibody inhibited the cell growth of colon cancer cells in a concentration-dependent manner. The anti-CHI3L1 antibody also reduced the migration but increased apoptotic cell death in colon cancer cells. Using STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins), we identified an association between VEGFA and CHI3L1 in colon cancer. We confirmed interaction between VEGFA and CHI3L1 through immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, the combination treatment of the anti-CHI3L1 antibody and VEGFA siRNA inhibited cell growth but increased apoptotic cell death. Additionally, using the Human Base database, we found that CHI3L1 and VEGFA are associated with nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). Furthermore, combining the anti-CHI3L1 antibody and NAMPT siRNA more effectively reduced cell growth and the expression of CHI3L1, VEGFA, and cell growth-related proteins, but significantly increased apoptosis-related proteins. The combination of VEGFA siRNA and NAMPT siRNA more effectively inhibited cell growth. Anti-CHI3L1 antibody inhibited the production of ATP and NADH in colon cancer and had a higher inhibitory effect on these levels when combined with NAMPT siRNA These data demonstrated that anti-CHI3L1 antibody is useful as a potential therapy for colon cancer by inhibiting NAMPT-dependent VEGFA expression and ATP and NADH levels."
0,"Transduction of murine colon carcinoma cells with interleukin-15 gene induces antitumor effects in immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts. We examined the antitumor effects caused by murine colon carcinoma cells (Colon 26) transduced with interleukin-15 (IL-15) gene. Although the in vitro proliferation rate of IL-15-secreting Colon 26 (Colon 26/IL-15) cells was not different from that of wild-type (wt) cells, small subcutaneous tumors of Colon 26/IL-15 cells that developed in syngeneic immunocompetent mice regressed spontaneously in contrast to tumors of wt cells. The mice that had eliminated tumors of Colon 26/IL-15 cells rejected wt cells when subsequently challenged. The survival of the mice that had been inoculated intraperitoneally with Colon 26/IL-15 cells was significantly prolonged compared with that of the mice injected with wt cells. However, in an experimental lung metastasis model, the survival of the mice inoculated with Colon 26/IL-15 cells remained the same as that of the mice inoculated with wt cells. The inoculation of Colon 26/IL-15 cells into immunocompromised nude or severe combined immunodeficient mice produced tumors, but the survival of the immunocompromised mice was significantly longer than that of the mice inoculated with wt cells. The nude mice inoculated with Colon 26/IL-15 cells also survived longer than the severe combined immunodeficient mice with Colon 26/IL-15 cells. Depletion of natural killer cells in nude mice with anti-asialo GM1 antibody did not influence the survival of the mice injected with Colon 26/IL-15 cells. Immunohistological examination revealed that CD31+ cells migrated into tumors of Colon 26/IL-15 cells that developed in immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice. Taken together, our results indicate that an inoculation of IL-15-producing tumor cells can produce antitumor effects that are mediated by a variety of immunocompetent cells."
0,"Paracrine factors from adipose-mesenchymal stem cells enhance metastatic capacity through Wnt signaling pathway in a colon cancer cell co-culture model Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in tumors have emerged as progenitors involved in stroma formation and metastasis of cancers, partially owing to their abilities to differentially express paracrine factors related to the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells. In this regard, increasing evidence has shown that MSCs have impacts on the malignancy of colon cancer, however, the underpinning mechanisms by which MSCs promote cancer metastasis remain elusive. To investigate the crosstalk between adipose-derived MSCs (AMSCs) isolated from adipose tissues and colon cancer cells, a co-culture transwell model of AMSCs and colon cancer cells was employed, and the activation of Wnt signaling and paracrine factors in colon cancer cells and AMSCs were measured. The results showed that AMSCs could enhance the metastatic capacity of colon cancer cells with an elevated expression of mesenchymal-epithelial transition (EMT)-associated genes in a contact-dependent manner. Reciprocally, colon cancer cells were able to induce AMSCs to produce metastasis-related factors and cytokines, such as FGF10, VEGFC and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in part through a mechanism of an activation of Wnt signaling, by which these factors in turn activate Wnt signaling of colon cancer cells. Intriguingly, an inhibition of Wnt signaling leads a reduced capacity of invasion and colony formation of colon cancer cells in vitro, and the tumorigenicity of cancer cells in a murine model. These findings thus suggest that the crosstalk between the Wnt signaling of cancer cells and paracrine factors of AMSCs has an implication in colon cancer malignancy. This study thus uncovers a novel Wnt-paracrine factors mediated-crosstalk between colon cancer cells and AMSCs in cancer malignancy."
0,"Secretion of interleukin-10 from murine colon carcinoma cells suppresses systemic antitumor immunity and impairs protective immunity induced against the tumors Interleukin -10 ( IL -10 ) is a T helper type 2 ( Th2 ) cytokine that suppresses Th1 -mediated, cell -mediated immune responses and reciprocally enhances antibody -mediated responses. Previous studies, however, demonstrated that forced expression of the IL -10 gene in tumor cells could unexpectedly produce antitumor effects. We then examined whether tumor -derived IL -10 could modulate systemic immune responses. Murine colon carcinoma ( Colon 26 ) cells that were retrovirally transduced with the murine IL -10 gene ( Colon 26 / IL -10 ) were inoculated in syngeneic immunocompetent or T cell -defective nude mice. Growth of Colon 26 / IL -10 tumors was augmented in immunocompetent and, to less extent, in nude mice compared with that of wild -type tumors developed in respective mice. Growth of wild -type tumors was accelerated to the same level as that of Colon 26 / IL -10 tumors when wild type and Colon 26 / IL -10 cells were respectively inoculated in different flanks of the same immunocompetent mice. This enhanced growth of wild -type tumors was not observed in nude mice. Immunocompetent mice that had rejected IL -2 -or IL -12 -secreting Colon 26 cells developed protective immunity and became completely resistant to wild -type Colon 26 cells subsequently challenged. However, some of the mice that had rejected IL -2 or IL -12 producers developed Colon 26 / IL -10 tumors inoculated thereafter. The present study showed that production of IL -10 from tumor cells impaired T cell -and non -T cell -mediated systemic antitumor immunity in hosts."
0,"Developmental pluripotency-associated 4: a novel predictor for prognosis and a potential therapeutic target for colon cancer. Developmental pluripotency-associated 4 (Dppa4) gene plays an important role in self-renewal and pluripotency sustainability in embryonic stem cells. It is re-expressed in several malignant tumors and is identified as a new pluripotency-related oncogene. The present study investigates the expression and clinical significance of Dppa4 in colon cancer. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting were used to evaluate Dppa4 mRNA and protein expression in 39 pairs of fresh-frozzen colon cancer samples, which were compared with adjacent normal mucosa. The Dppa4 protein was evaluated by immunohistochemical techniques using colon tissue microarrays (TMA). The sample included 185 cancer specimens and corresponding normal colorectal mucosa. The effect of Dppa4 knockdown on colorectal cancer cell proliferation was investigated using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) assays and colony-formation assays. Both the mRNA and protein level expression of Dppa4 gene was found to be upregulated in colon cancer tissues. Furthermore, the upregulated expression of Dppa4 was significantly correlated with the results of American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage (P = 0.01), invasion depth (P = 0.028), nodal involvement (P = 0.012), distant metastasis (P = 0.003), and differentiation (P = 0.002). Dppa4 was also shown to be an independent prognostic indicator of disease-free survival (HR 6.118, 95 % CI 3.004–12.462) and overall survival (HR 6.348, 95 % CI 2.875–14.014) for patients with colon cancer. Knockdown of Dppa4 expression inhibited the proliferation of colorectal cancer cell lines through G1/S transition regulation. The results indicate that Dppa4 might play an important role in colon cancer progression and function as a novel prognostic indicator and a potential therapeutic target."
0,"Surgical resection of locally advanced primary transverse colon cancer--not a worse outcome in stage II tumor. In locally advanced primary transverse colon cancer, a tumor may cause perforation or invade adjacent organs. Extensive resection is the best choice of treatment, but such procedures must be weighed against the potential survival benefits. This study was performed to identify the clinicopathological features and treatment outcomes of such tumors. We retrospectively reviewed the database of the Colorectal Cancer Registry of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between February 1995 and December 2005. Patients with colon cancer sited between the hepatic and splenic flexure that involved an adjacent organ without distant metastasis were defined as having locally advanced transverse colon cancer. A total of 827 patients who underwent surgery for transverse primary colon cancer were enrolled in the study. Stage II and stage III colon cancer were diagnosed in 548 patients. Thirty-two (5.8%) patients were diagnosed with locally advanced tumors. Multivariate analysis revealed that stage III, preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen ≥5 ng/mL, a tumor with perforation or obstruction, and the presence of a locally advanced tumor were significant prognostic factors for both overall and cancer-specific survival. Postoperative morbidity rates differed significantly between the locally advanced and non-locally advanced tumor groups (22.7% vs. 12.3%, P < 0.01). No significant overall survival difference was observed among the stage II transverse colon tumors (P = 0.21). Surgical resection of locally advanced transverse colon tumors resulted in a higher morbidity and mortality than that of non-locally advanced tumors, but the benefit of extensive surgery in the case of locally advanced tumors cannot be underestimated. Furthermore, this benefit is more pronounced in the case of stage II tumors."
0,"Oroxylin A suppresses the development and growth of colorectal cancer through reprogram of HIF1α-modulated fatty acid metabolism The occurrence and progress of colon cancer are closely associated with obesity. Therefore, the lipid metabolism, especially fatty acid metabolism, is a significant section of energy homeostasis in colon cancer cells, and it affects many important cellular processes. Oroxylin A is one of the main bioactive flavonoids of Scutellariae radix, which has a strong anticancer effect but low toxicity to normal tissue. In previous studies, we have proved that oroxylin A reprogrammes metabolism of cancer cells by inhibiting glycolysis. Here, we further investigated the metabolism-modulating effects of oroxylin A on the fatty acid metabolism in colon cancer cells under hypoxia. We found that HIF1α upregulated adipophilin, fatty acid synthase and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1, and downregulated carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), resulting in the promoted lipid uptake and transport, increased de novo fatty acid synthesis and suppressed fatty acid oxidation. Oroxylin A inactivated HIF1α and reprogrammed fatty acid metabolism of HCT116 cells, decreasing intracellular fatty acid level and enhancing fatty acid oxidation. Furthermore, the rapid decrease of fatty acid level caused by oroxylin A inhibited the nuclear translocation of β-cantenin and inactivated the Wnt pathway, arousing cell cycle arrest in G2/M phase. In vivo studies demonstrated that high-fat diet increased the incidence of colon cancer and accelerated tumor development. Importantly, besides the growth inhibitory effects on colon cancer xenograft, oroxylin A prevented carcinogenesis and delayed progress of primary colon cancer as well. Our studies enriched the metabolic regulatory mechanism of oroxylin A, and suggested that oroxylin A was a potent candidate for the treatment and prevention of colorectal cancer."
0,"The miR-487b-3p/GRM3/TGFβ signaling axis is an important regulator of colon cancer tumorigenesis Molecular targeting is an import strategy to treat advanced colon cancer. The current study demonstrates that expression of GRM3, a metabotropic glutamate receptor mainly expressed in mammalian central nervous system, is significantly upregulated in majority of human colonic adenocarcinomas tested and colon cancer cell lines. Knockdown of GRM3 expression or inhibition of GRM3 activation in colon cancer cells reduces cell survival and anchorage-independent growth in vitro and inhibits tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, GRM3 antagonizes TGFβ-mediated activation of protein kinase A and inhibition of Protein kinase B (AKT). In addition, TGFβ signaling increases GRM3 protein stability and knockdown of GRM3 enhances TGFβ-mediated tumor suppressor function. Further studies indicate that miR-487b-3p directly targets GRM3. Overexpression of miR-487b-3p mimics the effects of GRM3 knockdown and suppresses the tumorigenicity of colon cancer cells in vivo. Expression of miR-487b-3p is decreased in colon adenocarcinomas and inversely correlates with GRM3 expression. Taken together, these studies indicate that upregulation of GRM3 expression is a functionally important molecular event in colon cancer, and that GRM3 is a promising molecular target for colon cancer treatment. This is particularly interesting and important from a therapeutic standpoint because numerous metabotropic glutamate receptor antagonists are available, many of which have been found unsuitable for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders for reasons such as inability to readily penetrate blood brain barriers. As GRM3 is upregulated in colon cancer, but rarely expressed in normal peripheral tissues, targeting GRM3 with such agents would not likely cause adverse neurological or peripheral side effects, making GRM3 an attractive and specific molecular target for colon cancer treatment."

We evaluated KPNA2 mRNA and protein expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting in 40 primary colon cancer tissues and paired adjacent normal colon mucosa specimens. KPNA2 protein expression in colon tissue microarray of tumor and normal tissue specimens and lymph node metastasis specimens obtained from 195 colon cancer patients were analyzed immunohistochemically. The effect of KPNA2 knockdown on carcinogenesis potential of human colon cancer cells was determined using Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8), colony formation, cell migration, and tumorigenesis in nude mice. KPNA2 was expressed at higher levels in colon tumors and lymph node metastasis specimens than in normal tissues. Patients with KPNA2-positive tumors were significantly correlated with the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage (p = 0.01), T-classification (p = 0.018), regional lymph node metastasis (p = 0.025), distant metastasis (p = 0.014), and differentiated degree (p = 0.001). KPNA2 was shown to be an independent prognostic indicator of disease-free survival (HR 1.681; 95 % CI: 1.170–2.416; p = 0.005) and overall survival (HR 2.770; 95 % CI: 1.314–5.837; p = 0.007) for patients with colon cancer. Knockdown of KPNA2 expression inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation, colony formation, and migration. KPNA2 might play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis and functions as a novel prognostic indicator and a potential therapeutic target for colorectal cancer."

Appropriately selecting patients for whom PALN dissection will provide oncologic benefit remains challenging. This study identified factors to predict survival among patients undergoing PALN dissection for colorectal cancer.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">An institutional database was queried for patients who underwent curative-intent resection of clinically positive PALN for colorectal cancer between 2007 and 2020. Preoperative radiologic images were reviewed, and patients who did and did not have positive PALN on final pathology were compared. Survival analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of pathologically positive PALN on recurrence-free (RFS) and overall survival (OS).</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Of 74 patients who underwent PALN dissection, 51 had PALN metastasis at the time of primary tumor diagnosis, whereas 23 had metachronous PALN disease. Preoperative chemotherapy ± radiotherapy was given in 60 cases (81.1%), and 28 (37.8%) had pathologically positive PALN. Independent factors associated with positive PALN pathology included metachronous PALN disease and pretreatment and posttreatment radiographically abnormal PALN. On multivariable analysis, pathologically positive PALN was significantly associated with decreased RFS (hazard ratio 3.90) and OS (HR 4.49). Among patients with pathologically positive PALN, well/moderately differentiated histology was associated with better OS, and metachronous disease trended toward an association with better OS.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Pathologically positive PALN are associated with poorer RFS and OS after PALN dissection for colorectal cancer. Clinicopathologic factors may predict pathologic PALN positivity.

0,"PKN2 in colon cancer cells inhibits M2 phenotype polarization of tumor-associated macrophages via regulating DUSP6-Erk1/2 pathway. Protein kinase N2 (PKN2) is a PKC-related serine/threonine-protein kinase. PKN2 is required for tumor cell migration, invasion and apoptosis. However, the functional role of PKN2 in regulating tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) polarization in colon cancer has never been reported. PKN2 expression in human colon cancer tissues was examined with immunohistochemistry (IHC). M1/M2 macrophage signatures were evaluated by RT-PCR, IHC and flow cytometry. The effects of PKN2 on tumor growth and TAM polarization were investigated both in vitro and in vivo. PKN2 targeted cytokines/pathway were analyzed by gene expression analysis and further confirmed by PCR, luciferase assay or western blot. Correlations between PKN2 and transcriptional factors for IL4 and IL10 were confirmed by ChIP-qPCR. The catalytic activities of PKN2 and DUSP6 were determined by kinase activity assay. Interactions between PKN2 and DUSP6 were confirmed by Co-IP. The expression of PKN2 in colon cancer cells predicted a favorable prognosis and was associated with low M2 macrophage content in human colon cancer tissues. PKN2 inhibited tumor growth in mice xenograft model and inhibited M2 phenotype polarization both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, PKN2 suppresses the expression of IL4 and IL10 from colon cancer cells by inhibiting Erk1/2 phosphorylation, which is required for phosphorylation and binding of CREB and Elk-1 to the promoters of IL4 and IL10. DUSP6, which is phosphorylated and activated through direct association with PKN2, suppresses Erk1/2 activation. The expression of PKN2 in colon cancer cells suppresses tumor associated M2 macrophage polarization and tumor growth. Targeting PKN2 signaling pathway may provide a potential therapeutic strategy for colon cancer."
0,"ACTL6A expression promotes invasion, metastasis and epithelial mesenchymal transition of colon cancer Metastasis is the main cause of death in patients with advanced stage colon cancer. Epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays an important role in invasion and metastasis. Actin-like 6A (ACTL6A) is vital for embryogenesis and differentiation and is also critical for metastasis and EMT in hepatocellular carcinoma, as observed in our previous study. In the present study, we further explored the role of ACTL6A in colon cancer metastasis. ACTL6A expression levels were analyzed in normal colon, colon adenoma and colon cancer specimens using public databases and tissue samples. ACTL6A expression and its association with clinicopathologic features of colon cancer patients were also analyzed. ACTL6A-overexpression and ACTL6A-knockdown colon cancer cells were used to perform cytological experiments to explore the potential biological function of ACTL6A in metastasis and EMT in colon cancer. The data from both the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Oncomine databases showed that ACTL6A expression levels in colon adenoma and cancer were higher than those in normal colon samples. The ACTL6A expression level in fresh colon cancer specimens was also higher than that in the corresponding adjacent normal colon specimens. Patients with high ACTL6A expression directly correlated with advanced pT status, distant metastasis, poor differentiation and microvascular/perineural invasion. ACTL6A overexpression promoted migration and invasion of colon cancer cells, whereas ACTL6A knockdown exhibited the opposite effect in vitro. Moreover, we demonstrated that ACTL6A promoted EMT in colon cancer cells in vitro. Our findings indicate that ACTL6A exhibits pro-tumor function and acts as an EMT activator in colon cancer. ACTL6A may serve as a potential therapeutic target for colon cancer."
0,"Biobanking of Fresh-frozen Human Colon Tissues: Impact of Tissue Ex-vivo Ischemia Times and Storage Periods on RNA Quality Background. Biobanking plays an important role in translational cancer research. The impact of tissue ex-vivo ischemia time and storage period on RNA integrity is not well documented. Methods. Fresh-frozen colon tissues were collected in Taizhou Hospital of Zhejiang Province in China since 2004. Fifty-one colon cancer tissues with tumor cell content higher than 70 % and matched normal tissues during four storage periods (less than 15 months, 16–20 months, 21–25 months, and 26–40 months) were chosen to detect RNA quality. Fresh colon cancer tissues from 5 patients were cut into pieces and kept at room temperature or on ice for 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h before snap freezing. RNA integrity was determined by microcapillary electrophoresis by the RNA integrity number (RIN) algorithm. Results. Sixty-seven percent of normal colon tissues and 94 % of colon cancer specimens yielded RNA with a RIN of C7. Matched colon cancer and normal tissues showed significant difference in RNA quality. RNA remained stable in colon cancer tissues kept at room temperature and on ice for up to 4 h, and long-term storage of banked colon specimens did not negatively influence RNA quality (RNA with RIN of C7 banked less than 15 months, 83 %; 16–20 months, 78 %; 21–25 months, 77 %; 26–40 months, 90 %). Conclusions. Frozen colon tissues yield high-quality RNA in approximately 80 % of specimens. Ex-vivo ischemia times and storage periods did not adversely affect RNA quality. This study showed that standard operation protocols and the maintenance of high-quality tissue repositories were the keys to translational medicine research."

0,"Stat3 up-regulates expression of nicotinamide N -methyltransferase in human cancer cells To discover new molecular targets for cancer therapy and diagnosis, we surveyed signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (Stat3)-regulated genes, because constitutive activation of Stat3 is associated with a wide variety of human malignancies. We investigated the Stat3-regulated genes in 293 cells with cDNA microarray analysis and found that Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) was induced on stimulation of the cells with leukemia inhibitory factor. We examined the expression of NNMT in several types of cancer cells by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. To examine the role of Stat3, Hep-G2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells were transfected with NNMT promoter-luciferase reporter construct together with conditionally active Stat3 (Stat3ER) or dominant-negative Stat3 expression vector and NNMT promoter activity was determined. The expression of NNMT and activated Stat3 in 88 colon cancer tissues and 17 normal colon tissues was examined with immunohistochemical analysis. In Hep-G2 cells and SW480 colon cancer cells, NNMT expression increased on stimulation of the cells with interleukin 6. NNMT promoter activity in Hep-G2 cells was dependent on the activation of Stat3. MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells and HT29 colon cancer cells expressed constitutively a high level of NNMT. Treatment of these cells with Stat3 siRNA or curcumin, which inhibited Stat3 phosphorylation, resulted in reduction of the NNMT level. We found a correlation between the expression of NNMT and activated Stat3 (P < 0.001) in the colon cancer tissues. NNMT is a novel Stat3-regulated gene. Its expression is enhanced with the activation of Stat3 in colon cancer tissues. NNMT may be a potential candidate for a tumor marker of various kinds of cancers."

In this study, we evaluated knowledge of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers in people referred for endoscopy and colonoscopy screening. This cross-sectional study was carried out among 461 people who were under the patronage of a local relief foundation and referred for endoscopy and colonoscopy to the Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease Research Center (GLDRC), Rasht, north of Iran, from March 2016 to March 2017. A well-defined two-sectioned questionnaire was carried out for each group. Overall, 300 and 161 individuals were in the gastric and colon cancer knowledge group, respectively. The level of knowledge in various areas of gastric and colon cancer was desirable. In general, the average of different domains in gastric and colon cancer knowledge questions were 20.2 ± 6.6 and 19.2 ± 4.9, with the knowledge level higher than the mean in gastric cancer (58%) and colon cancer (67.1%). The mean score of knowledge of GI cancers in terms of risk factor indicated a significant relationship between BMI and alcohol consumption. Meanwhile, a meaningful relationship between symptoms and BMI with knowledge was declared. About domains of colon cancer, there was a significant relationship between younger age and knowledge in the risk factor. The results of this study can provide an opportunity to formulate strategies to achieve goals, especially in the field of education, prevention, and control of the disease by raising knowledge for the general public and educating people who are responsible for providing and delivering health services to this community."
0,"Endoscopic resection of T1 colorectal cancer prior to surgery does not affect surgical adverse events and recurrence Although a “no-touch isolation” technique is used in colorectal cancer surgery to reduce the risk of metastatic induction, endoscopic resection (ER) prior to surgery may work against this aim. This study evaluated the effects of initial ER on short- and long-term outcomes in T1 colorectal cancer. This retrospective cohort study enrolled patients with pathological T1 colorectal cancer who underwent colorectal surgical resection at a Japanese tertiary cancer center between 2002 and 2012. A total of 548 eligible patients were divided into two groups: patients initially treated using surgical resection with lymph node dissection (LND) (primary group, n = 304) and patients treated using initial ER and additional surgical resection with LND (secondary group, n = 244). The inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) method based on propensity score was used to compare postoperative complications and long-term recurrence. The incidence of postoperative complications with Clavien–Dindo classification grade ≥ II was 10.9% and 7.4% in the primary and secondary groups, respectively (p = 0.16). Multivariate analysis with a logistic proportional hazard regression model using IPTW revealed no significant differences in postoperative complications between the two groups (p = 0.79). During a median follow-up after surgery of 61.4 months, recurrence was observed in 3 (1.0%) and 8 (3.3%) patients, respectively (p = 0.06). Multivariate analysis with a Cox proportional hazard regression model using IPTW revealed no significant differences in recurrence between the two groups (p = 0.07). Our results suggest no significant adverse effects of initial ER prior to surgery on surgical complications and long-term recurrence in T1 colorectal cancer."
0,"ACLY facilitates colon cancer cell metastasis by CTNNB1 Colon cancer is the second leading cancer worldwide. Recurrent disease and chemotherapeutic drug resistance are very common in the advanced stage of colon cancer. ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY), the first-step rate-controlling enzyme in lipid synthesis, is elevated in colon cancer. However, it remains unclear about the exact role of ACLY in the development of colon cancer metastasis. To evaluate the role of ACLY in colon cancer metastasis, we performed cell migration and invasion assays in two ACLY-deficient colon cancer cell lines. Colon cancer mouse model is used to examine ACLY’s effects on colon metastasis potentials in vivo. We analyzed the correlation between ACLY and CTNNB1 protein in 78 colon cancer patients by Pearson correlation. To finally explore the relationship of ACLY and CTNNB1, we used western blots, migration and invasion assays to confirm that ACLY may regulate metastasis by CTNNB1. Our data showed that the abilities of cell migration and invasion were attenuated in ACLY-deficient HCT116 and RKO cell lines. Furthermore, we describe the mechanism of ACLY in promoting colon cancer metastasis in vitro and in vivo. ACLY could stabilize CTNNB1 (beta-catenin 1) protein by interacting, and the complex might promote CTNNB1 translocation through cytoplasm to nucleus, subsequently promote the CTNNB1 transcriptional activity and migration and invasion abilities of colon cancer cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of 78 colon cancer patients showed that the high expression levels of ACLY and CTNNB1 protein was positively correlated with metastasis of colon cancer. These results shed new light on the molecular mechanism underlying colon cancer metastasis, which might help in improving therapeutic efficacy."

0,"Laparoscopic ileo-transverse bypass may contribute to achieving curative resection for locally advanced right colon cancer: a case report. The strategy for treating obstructive colon cancers with metastatic lesions remains unclear. Herein, we report a case of laparoscopic ileo-transverse colon bypass (LITB) before preoperative chemotherapy for an obstructive right colon cancer. A 59-year-old woman was referred to our institution (Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Chiba Cancer Center) for liver tumors detected on ultrasound. The clinical diagnosis was ascending colon cancer with multiple liver metastases. Based on the criteria of the International Union against Cancer Committee, 8th edition, the staging was confirmed as cT4aN1M1a(H), cStage IV. Although the primary tumor in the ascending colon extended beyond the colonic wall, curative resection was possible for both primary and metastatic tumors. We planned to administer chemotherapy before the radical surgery to obtain tumor-free resection margins; however, as the obstruction was fatal, LITB was prioritized and performed using five ports. An intracorporeal side-to-side anastomosis was performed between the ileum, 25 cm from the terminal ileum, and the transverse colon. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 18 without any complications. After LITB, for preoperative chemotherapy, five courses of capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CapeOX) + bevacizumab were administered. Six weeks after the preoperative chemotherapy, right hemicolectomy with D3 lymph node dissection and right hepatectomy were performed. Pathological findings of the resected specimen confirmed curative resection of both lesions, and a favorable effect of chemotherapy was obtained. The patient has been alive for over 8 months after the surgery, with no evidence of cancer recurrence. This case report demonstrates the effectiveness of LITB for obstructive right colon cancer in patients who need preoperative chemotherapy."

To investigate the prognostic value of tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the distribution of cancer nest, cancer stroma and normal mucosa and FOXP3-positive cancer cells in colon cancer patients after resection. Paraffin blocks of operation resection of primary adenocarcinoma of colon were obtained from ninety patients. The distribution of tumor-infiltrating Tregs was detected by tissue microarray and immunohistochemistry staining technique to evaluate the prognostic effects by Kaplan–Meier and Cox regression analysis using median values as cutoff. The intratumoral Tregs counts were significantly higher than that in corresponding normal mucosa tissues (P < 0.001); the Tregs counts in cancer nest were significantly lower than that in corresponding cancer stroma tissues (P < 0.001); the increased intratumoral Tregs counts were associated with favorable prognosis (P < 0.05); the presence of Tregs in cancer nest was associated with unfavorable prognosis and was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P < 0.05). The appearance of FOXP3-positive cancer cells was associated with worse prognosis (P < 0.05). In addition, the frequency of the presence of FOXP3-positive cancer cells was higher in patients with lymphatic invasion (P < 0.001) and lower in patients with early TNM stage (P < 0.01). The higher tumor-infiltrating Tregs counts are closely associated with the improved prognostic effects of colon carcinoma. Tregs play different roles in cancer nest and cancer stroma. And the appearance of Tregs in cancer nest is a promising independent risk factor for overall survival in colon carcinoma. FOXP3-positive cancer cells may also be a risk factor for overall survival in colon carcinoma."

0,"Epidural analgesia associated with better survival in colon cancer. Surgery remains the mainstay of treatment for potentially curable colon cancer. Otherwise, the surgical stress response might increase the likelihood of cancer dissemination during and after cancer surgery. There is growing evidence that the type of anaesthesia during cancer surgery plays a role in the metastatic process. Therefore, we assessed if the method of anaesthesia is associated with long-term survival after colon cancer surgery. A retrospective single-centre study was conducted including 588 patients who underwent colorectal cancer surgery, TNM stage I–IV, in the Jeroen Bosch Hospital between 1995 and 2003. The Cox proportional hazard model was used for statistical analysis. Adjustments were made for age, sex, comorbidity, TNM stage, chemotherapy, emergency surgery status and year of incidence. Of the 588 primary colon cancer patients with a median age of 70 years, 399 (68 %) patients underwent colon surgery with epidural anaesthesia, whilst 189 (32 %) patients were operated without epidural anaesthesia. Five-year survival for patients not receiving epidural analgesia was 42 % versus 51 % for patients receiving epidural analgesia (p = 0.03). This effect remained after adjustment for relevant patient, tumour, and treatment characteristics (hazard ratio (HR) 1.30 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.05–1.59), p = 0.01). Subgroup analysis in patients of 80 years and older (n = 100) showed also a better overall survival after receiving epidural analgesia (HR 1.74 (95 % CI 1.11–2.72), p = 0.01). Epidural analgesia during colon cancer surgery was associated with a better overall survival. Prospective trials evaluating the effects of locoregional analgesia on colon cancer recurrence are warranted."
