3,"Mutations and polymorphisms of genes moderate increase in gastric cancer risk Results of studies performed in our center point at DNA changes of many cancer (mostly moderate) susceptibility genes. Association of ""weak"" mutations and polymorphism of many genes and additional influence of environmental factors can significantly increase the risk of cancer development.; ; The preliminary studies performed in our department indicate, that increased risk of gastric cancer may be related to mutation in NOD2 and CHK2 genes predisposing to cancers of many organs.; ; The CHEK2 gene encodes checkpoint kinase 2 (Chk2), it acts as a tumor suppressor whose functions are central to the induction of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis by DNA damage.; ; Results of studies performed in our center indicate that the frequency of the IVS2+1G→A alteration was significantly increased in a group of 658 consecutive patients, especially in those under 50 years of age (OR=5.332, p=0.0174). I157T was over-represented in the group of familial gastric cancer patients, particularly in patients diagnosed at less than 50 years of age (OR=3.687, p=0.0011) and females. The specific group of intestinal and mixed histopathological subtype occurs more frequently (OR=1.671) in consecutive carriers of I157T mutation.; ; Recently, the NOD2/CARD15, gene located on chromosome 16q12, has been associated with Crohn’s disease. It is believed to play a role both in intracellular recognition of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) typical of Gram negative bacteria and subsequent activation of NFkB. 3020insC NOD2 mutation causes an increased risk of developing chronic inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract and colorectal cancer in their course. In light of recent studies, in fact 3020insC mutation predisposes to cancers of many organs, including breast, ovarian, lung. Studies conducted in our center in the group of 103 patients with a family history of gastric cancer, have shown that NOD2 3020insC carriers in persons over 50 y of age more than doubled (OR=2.479, p=0.022) and among women almost 3-fold increased risk. In addition, NOD2 R702W alteration occurred almost three times more frequently (OR=2.816, p=0.0121) in the group of 241 consecutive patients with gastric cancer diagnosed before 50 years of age and over 2-times frequently (OR=2.268, p=0.0371) in gastric cancer selected histopathologically as intestinal type according to Lauren.; ; There are a large number of reports describing the relationship between changes in the gene TP53, particularly polimomorfizm Arg72Pro, and risk of gastric cancer. Many researchers have found links between gene polymorphism of Interleukin-1, and the risk of stomach cancer. Gene polymorphism of angiotensin converting enzyme ACE, was recently linked with the pathogenesis and development of human cancers. Research Ebert MP, et al. conducted in a group of 88 patients shows that the insertion / deletion ACE gene may be associated with the development of early gastric cancer in the German population. In the Japanese population genetically distant, however, found no relationship between gastric cancer and ACE gene polymorphism). Sentences on the ACE polymorphism and risk of stomach cancer researchers are divided among different centers.; ; XRCC1 gene is part of composite protein complex containing the s-polymerase DNA ligase I and PARP (polymerase poly (ADP-ribose). This multi-unit complex is involved in DNA repair pathway. T. Poplawski et al. indicate that the variant Gln / Gln XRCC1 gene polymorphism Arg399Gly occurred more frequently in patients with gastric cancer and family burden (OR=2.04, 95% CI=1,27-3,29) and the results obtained from studies in the group of 152 patients with a family history of gastric cancer suggest that gene XRCC1 399Gln allele may be considered a marker of gastric cancer.; ; In terms of predisposition to gastric cancer has also been studied recently LAPTM4B gene associated with a genetic predisposition to liver cancer, having LAPTM4B alleles * 1 and LAPTM4B * 2. The risk of stomach cancer was increased 1.819 times in patients with genotype * 1 / 2 (CI=1.273-2.601) and 2.387 times in patients with genotype * 2 / 2 LAPTM4B (CI=1.195-4.767) compared with genotype * 1 / first. These studies indicate that allele * 2 LAPTM4B may be one of the genetic factors of gastric cancer.; ; Further studies of newly described mutation moderately increased risk of stomach cancer may allow to estimate the real risk of gastric cancer associated with these mutations in the Polish population."
3,"Hereditary colorectal cancer and Lynch syndrome The term Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer, or HNPCC, has been less used for naming the classical autosomal dominantly inherited susceptibility to cancer [1]. As this susceptibility applies to tumors from different primary sites other than but including colorectal cancer (CRC), the term Lynch Syndrome (LS) is a less restrictive name. Lynch Syndrome is characterized by an autosomal dominantly inherited susceptibility to cancer, caused by inherited germline mutations in the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. It is characterized by early age of onset, predilection to the proximal colon, multiple primary CRCs, and extracolonic tumors, particularly endometrium carcinoma (EC) [2,3].; ; To establish a profile of the disease, a better definition of the spectrum of related tumors has been a constant concern [4,5]. It is therefore expected to find heterogeneity among the families regarding the susceptibility to develop tumors in different specific sites. The risk of cancer in fact varies among families with LS, although the variation does not necessarily result from genetic heterogeneity. The standards of environmental exposure must contribute to the differential gene expression, justifying at least in part this heterogeneity [6].; ; LS accounts for 2%–5% of all CRC cases [7]. In fact, it is believed that 20% to 30% of patients with CRC present some type of genetic susceptibility, but without meeting criteria for known typical syndromes. However, new cancer cases in the patient’s family or supplemental information on previously unknown cases can lead to a reclassification that may characterize a typical syndrome. In other situations, despite the lack of clinical criteria for determining an inherited character, molecular inquiry can define the diagnosis of inherited syndrome. For these reasons, even in the absence of typical clinical characterization, criteria must be used to direct the inquiry of an inherited condition.; ; The spectrum of extracolonic tumors in LS began to be the subject of several publications in which the most common cancers found were those affecting the endometrium, the stomach and the urinary tract [8-14]. Watson and Lynch [6] calculated the frequency of cancer in other specific sites in 1,300 high-risk individuals from 23 families having LS and demonstrated a significant increase of the risk of developing cancer in the stomach (RR:4.1), small bowel (RR:25), kidneys (RR:3.2), ureter (RR:22), and ovary (RR:3.5). The proposed extracolonic cancers associated with LS are endometrium, stomach, ovary, small bowel, ureter, renal pelvis, brain, and hepatobiliary tract. Among these tumors, endometrium, ureter, renal pelvis, and small bowel cancers present the highest relative risk, and are therefore the most specific for LS.; ; The Amsterdam criteria for clinical diagnosis of LS are: (1) at least three relatives must have histologically verified CRC, endometrium, ureter, renal pelvis, or small bowel cancer; (2) one must be a first-degree relative of the other two; (3) at least two successive generations must be affected; (4) at least one of the relatives with cancer must have received the diagnosis before age 50; and (5) familial adenomatous polyposis must have been excluded. Because there are families with an MMR mutation present exclusively in patients with endometrial cancer without CRC, the requirement of at least one case of CRC was suppressed [15,16].; ; Patients with LS may also have sebaceous adenomas, sebaceous carcinomas, and multiple keratoacanthomas, findings consonant with Torre’s syndrome variant [17,18]. The definition of LS includes a familial clustering of colorectal and/or endometrial cancer and as associated cancers stomach, ovary, ureter/renal pelvis, brain, small bowel, hepatobiliary tract, and skin (sebaceous tumors) tumors [15,19].; ; As discussed by Vasen [20], since it is known that LS is caused by an mismatch repair gene defect and that the hallmark of the syndrome is microsatellite instability (MSI), more attention should be given to the so-called Bethesda guidelines, which describe almost all clinical conditions in which there is suspicion of LS and in which a search for MSI is indicated, mainly early onset of colorectal adenomas and cancer."
3,"Appropriateness of splenectomy for advanced cancer located in the upper third of the stomach In cases of total gastrectomy for cancer located in the upper third of the stomach, the appropriateness of performing a splenectomy as a preventive dissection for spleen hilum lymph node (station number 10) has been broadly discussed in terms of both oncological principle and operational safety; however, no conclusions have yet been reached. Regarding our report [1], Hanisch and Ziogas [2] questioned whether or not it was appropriate, based on oncological principles, to select a surgical procedure of spleen preservation for advanced cancer located in the upper third of the stomach, in particular for cases of pathologically advanced serosa-positive (pT3) and nodepositive disease. Certainly, in terms of oncological concerns, it is correct to point out that not performing a spleen hilum lymph node dissection for pT3 cases involves the risk of increasing the possibility of postoperative recurrence. This is because a surgical spleen hilum lymph node dissection can be expected to be effective because the spleen is an organ adjacent to the stomach, connected to the stomach via short gastric arteries, and also having a close relationship with the stomach through lymphatic routes. In fact, in Japan, for cases of advanced stomach cancer with wall invasion of pT2 or higher (pT2, T3, T4), gastrectomy together with a D2 lymph node dissection has been recommended as a standard therapy [3, 4]. The purpose of our present study is to compare the surgical results of laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG), which preserves the spleen, and open total gastrectomy (OTG). Candidates for LATG comprised cases of clinical T1 (cT1) early-stage stomach cancer, while candidates for OTG comprised cases of advanced cancers with lower potential for spleen hilum lymph node metastasis. Specifically, we conducted a retrospective analysis of cases with lesions sized 5 cm or less in which there was no infiltration of the serosa and the spleen was preserved for those in which the lesion did not come into contact with the greater curvature. In such cases, we believed that the risk of postoperative recurrence through spleen hilum lymph node metastasis was low. On the other hand, in cases in which the lesion-occupied region is the greater curvature or in which the diameter of the tumor is large, spleen hilum lymph node metastasis is highly likely to occur and total gastrectomy with splenectomy is therefore more likely to be necessary. For the OTG group in our present study, cases of up to cT2 in the preoperative diagnosis were selected as candidates; however, pathologically, pT3 was present in 13/44 cases (29.5%), thus indicating the difficulty in obtaining preoperative diagnosis of wall invasion. We hope there will be more progress in diagnostic techniques of wall invasion in the future. In retrospective studies of cases of splenectomy for cancer located in the upper third of the stomach in Europe and the USA [5, 6], in many cases, the 5-year survival rate of splenectomy cases is lower by 10% or more compared with cases of spleen preservation. However, it is believed that this reflects the fact that the splenectomy group contains more cases with high levels of advancement, or that these results are due to the poor short-term surgical results of the splenectomy group, and therefore, these results do not accurately reflect the oncological appropriateness of a splenectomy (i.e., the effects of lymph node dissection). On the other hand, in studies conducted in Japan, there are few reports in which the 5-year survival rate is improved by S. Sakuramoto (&) K. Yamashita M.

3,"Sentinel Node Biopsy in Early Gastric Cancer: Constant Exertion for Clinical Application Lymph node status is the most important prognostic factor in gastric cancer. Standard surgery, therefore, is radical subtotal or total gastrectomy with wide dissection of regional lymph nodes. Recently, the proportion of early gastric cancer has increased to more than 60% in Korea and Japan because of screening gastroscopy. The rate of lymph node metastasis in early gastric cancer ranges from 5 to 20%, which means that more than 80% of patients with early gastric cancer undergo unnecessarily wide excision of the stomach with aggressive lymphadenectomy. If there is a tool to predict the exact status of lymph nodes, radical gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy can be substituted with limited resection of stomach without lymph node dissection. However, preoperative endoscopic ultrasound and computed tomography have limited accuracy for nodal staging in gastric cancer patients. The sentinel node (SN) concept has been introduced into various solid tumors, including stomach cancer, to predict lymph node status. Ideally, if the SN has no metastasis, extensive lymphadenectomy can be avoided, the extent of resection of the stomach reduced, function preserved, complications lessened, recovery accelerated, and the quality of life for the patient improved. SN navigation surgery has been widely performed for the treatment of breast cancer and malignant melanoma. Regarding gastric cancer, it seemed that SN concept is difficult to apply because the lymphatic flow is multidirectional. However, many studies reported that SN mapping is feasible in gastric cancer especially in early gastric cancer even though many issues still remain to be solved. Sensitivity of SN biopsy is highly important in gastric cancer compared with breast cancer and malignant melanoma. When false-negative cases develop in patients with malignant melanoma or breast cancer, other treatment options, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy exist. Because gastric cancer has no other treatment option except surgery, a gastric cancer patient with false-negative SN loses an opportunity for cure. The detection rate is not as important as sensitivity in gastric cancer SN biopsy. Surgeons should perform just conventional lymphadenectomy for detection failure cases. Sensitivities of SN mapping in gastric cancer reported until now are not adequate for clinical application. Until now, the sensitivities were generally low and even the studies with high sensitivity had small number of cases with lymph node metastasis. There are several methods to increase the sensitivity of SN biopsy in gastric cancer. As pathologic methods, multiple sections of the SN may raise the rate of detecting lymph node metastases. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining with anti-cytokeratin antibody helps to detect micrometastases in SNs in addition to conventional hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen, cytokeratin, or CD44, also is good tool for molecular detection of SN micrometastases. Rapid IHC or real-time RT-PCR is needed so that IHC or RT-PCR is applicable to SN biopsy for gastric cancer. Takeuchi et al. 1 introduced a novel realtime multiplex RT-PCR assay that is suitable for intraoperative detection of micrometastasis in SNs for the patients with clinical N0 gastric carcinoma. In the present study, 31% of patients with no metastasis over histological diagnosis were RT-PCR positive and the diagnostic accuracy is significantly higher in their multiplex RT-PCR assay than in intraoperative histopathology. Because the time taken for the assay is just 80 minutes, real-time multiplex RT-PCR is thought to be applicable for use in the intraoperative diagnosis of SN. Society of Surgical Oncology 2011"
3,"Do We Need Multiple Biopsies for Assessing Gastric Cancer Risk It is widely accepted that differentiated-type gastric cancers evolve through a multistep process starting with Helicobacter pylori-associated superficial gastritis, followed by atrophy, intestinal metaplasia (IM), dysplasia, and finally carcinoma [1]. Thus, the identification of such precancerous condition and follow-up of patients in whom they are found could lead to the diagnosis of gastric cancer at early stage and improved patient survival. However, diagnosis of atrophy and IM by conventional white light endoscopy has high inter-observer variability [2] and a poor correlation with histological findings [3]. Consequently, the diagnosis of atrophy or IM is currently based on histology of biopsy specimens from certain anatomic locations of the gastric mucosa, i.e., the updated Sydney system [4]. This system recommends taking at least five biopsy specimens (two from the antrum, two from the corpus and one from the incisura angularis) to grade severity of neutrophils (activity) and lymphocytic infiltration (inflammation), glandular atrophy (atrophy), and intestinal metaplasia. A recent Western publication proposes a staging system to classify gastric cancer risk in clinical practice on the basis of the histological findings of multiple biopsies [5]. The reason for taking biopsies from multiple sites in the stomach is that the grade and distribution of gastritis are different at each site of the stomach in a patient with chronic atrophic gastritis. Mapping studies of biopsy findings suggested that chronic atrophic gastritis develops from the lesser curvature of the lower gastric body and extends upward and laterally in the corpus [6]; therefore, knowledge of the biopsy site is important to interpret histological finding of gastritis in multiple biopsy specimens. When we investigated association between gastric cancer risk and histological grade of gastritis at the each biopsy site in the stomach, the presence of IM in the lesser curvature of the corpus had the strongest association with cancer risk among other findings of gastritis in the other sites [7]. Although gastritis is regarded as a histological entity, many attempts have been made to diagnose the disease macroscopically during esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). Kimura et al. [8] suggested that the endoscopic finding of atrophic mucosa was pale yellowish mucosa with increased mucosal vessel visibility, indicating that it was related to histological finding of atrophy of fundic gland (pseudo-pylorization) by step-wise biopsy across the endoscopic atrophic border. When the atrophic border remained on the lesser curvature of the corpus, the diagnosis was made as closed-type atrophic gastritis (antral predominant gastritis), whereas when the atrophic border no longer exists on the lesser curvature and extends along the anterior and posterior walls of the stomach, the diagnosis was made as open-type atrophic gastritis (pangastritis or corpus predominant gastritis). This endoscopic diagnostic criterion is commonly accepted and practically used for the diagnosis of chronic atrophic gastritis in Japan. Actually, Uemura et al. [9] indicated that extent of mucosal atrophy diagnosed by endoscopy was associated with risk for development of gastric cancer in a large-scale cohort study. In contrast to point evaluation of gastritis by biopsy, endoscopy is advantageous to evaluate the actual extent and distribution of atrophy or IM in the gastric mucosa that is related to gastric carcinogenesis. Ahn et al. [10] showed that mucosa in patients with open-type atrophic gastritis had more IM and Cdx2 N.

3,"Is Pylorus-preserving Gastrectomy Universally Applicable to Early Gastric Cancer of the Mid Stomach? Recent advances in endoscopic diagnosis have allowed gastric cancer to be diagnosed early, often in asymptomatic patients. Currently, endoscopic mucosal resection and endoscopic submucosal dissection are accepted as the least invasive procedures when managing early gastric cancer (cT1). An important intermediate option before open gastrectomy is laparoscopic gastrectomy. Advanced laparoscopic gastrectomy contributes to both improved esthetics and earlier postoperative recovery. However, quality of life is mainly affected by late-postoperative phase complications, such as dumping syndrome and loss in body weight resulting from reduced oral intake. Pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG), with limited stomach resection and lymph node dissection, is an example of function-preserving surgery that can improve late-postoperative phase function. In general, PPG is applicable to patients who were preoperatively diagnosed with cT1N0M0 primary gastric cancer in the middle third of the stomach, when the distal tumor border is C4 cm away from the pylorus. During the procedure, infrapyloric vessels are routinely preserved to maintain a suitable blood supply to the pyloric cuff, as is the root of the right gastric artery. Furthermore, the hepatic and pyloric branches of the vagus nerves are routinely preserved. More recently, laparoscopy-assisted pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (LAPPG) with lymphadenectomy has presented an attractive option. Several groups have indicated that LAPPG is a feasible and reliable procedure with satisfactory postoperative symptoms and functional outcomes. However, the incidence of metastasis in the preserved regional lymph nodes remains an obstacle to the wider application of the function-preserving surgery. In particular, lymph nodes at the suprapyloric and infrapyloric stations may be incompletely dissected when preserving nerve and arterial branches in either PPG or LAPPG. Therefore, metastatic tumor in residual suprapyloric and infrapyloric lymph nodes may contribute to disease recurrence in patients who undergo PPG. Although several studies have indicated acceptable long-term outcomes and survival rates after both PPG and LAPPG, neither has gained widespread use in standard clinical practice. Recently, Kim et al. attempted to evaluate the status of micrometastasis in suprapyloric and infrapyloric lymph nodes in early gastric cancers that are located in the mid stomach and managed with PPG. They found that the mean number of collected suprapyloric lymph nodes was significantly lower after PPG than with conventional distal gastrectomy; the findings were not significant for infrapyloric lymph nodes. Moreover, they determined that all metastasis (both macro and micro) to suprapyloric and infrapyloric lymph nodes are essentially very rare and that the long-term survival of patients after PPG was acceptable. They concluded that micrometastasis to the suprapyloric and infrapyloric lymph nodes may be negligible, and that PPG may be a safe procedure for early gastric cancer located in the mid stomach. This study essentially supports earlier work evaluating the oncological reliability of PPG. However, this study should be interpreted with caution because it was retrospective in design and involved a single-center cohort with a relatively small number of patients. Furthermore, the study failed to completely assess the primary tumor location (e.g., lesser curvature side, anterior wall). When evaluating a surgical procedure in a single-center study, results can be biased by the surgical skill base at that institution. In particular, LAPPG is a technically difficult surgery for inexperienced surgeons, involving precise Society of Surgical Oncology 2013"

Estimated average percent change (EAPC) of absolute counts (incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)) and age-standardized rates (age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR), age-standardized mortality rate (ASMR), and age-standardized DALYs rate (ASDALR)) was calculated in the regions to illustrate the relative changes between 1990 and 2019. Joinpoint regression was used to analyze global trends of stomach cancer burden in the last three decades.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Incidence of stomach cancer globally increased from 883,396 cases in 1990 to 1.3 million cases in 2019 and number of deaths due to stomach cancer rose from 788,317 in 1990 to 957,185 in 2019. Between 1990 and 2019, the global ASIR decreased from 22.4 per 100,000 to 15.6 per 100,000, the ASMR decreased from 20.5 per 100,000 to 11.9 per 100,000 and the ASDALR declined from 493.4 per 100,000 to 290.6 per 100,000. Trend analysis using joinpoint regression revealed the slowest rise in incident cases and largest decline in ASIR between 2004 and 2016. In 2019, East Asia had the highest number of incident cases, totaling 626,489, followed by high-income Asia-Pacific (128,168) and South Asia (99,399). The ASIR was the highest in East Asia (30.2/100,000) followed by high-income Asia-Pacific (28.2/100,000) and Andean Latin America (22.4/100,000), while high-income North America had the lowest ASIR at 6.1/100,000. In terms of absolute counts, the top three countries in 2019 were China, India, and Japan together accounting for 61.5% of global incident cases, 58.6% of deaths, and DALYs. Mongolia had the highest ASIR (43.7 per 100,000), followed by Bolivia (34.0 per 100,000) and China (30.6 per 100,000) in 2019, while the lowest ASIR was 3.3 per 100,000 in Malawi. Globally, for both sexes combined, 7.8% of stomach cancer DALYs were associated with a diet high in sodium and 17.2% were linked to smoking.

3,"Cancer mortality in a Chinese population surrounding a multi-metal sulphide mine in Guangdong province: an ecologic study The Dabaoshan mine in the southeast of Guangdong Province, China, is at high risk of multi-metal pollutant discharge into a local river (Hengshihe) and the surrounding area. Following approximately 30 years of exposure to these metals, little is known regarding the subsequent health effects and risks for the local residents. In our present study, we have estimated the relationships between long-term environmental exposure to multiple heavy metals and the risk of cancer mortality in a Chinese population in the vicinity of Dabaoshan. An ecologic study was performed. Between 2000-2007, a total population of 194,131 lived in the nine agricultural villages that surround the Hengshihe area. Heavy metals concentrations were determined in local environmental samples (water and crops) and whole blood taken from 1152 local residents of both a high-exposure area (HEA) and a low-exposure area (LEA). We calculated the rate ratio and standardized mortality ratios based on age- and gender-specific cancer mortality rates for the different reference populations (based on district, county and province). Simple, multiple linear and ridge regression models were used to evaluate the associations between exposure to multiple heavy metals and cancer mortality in the nine villages, after adjustment for age and sex. The geometric mean blood levels of cadmium and lead were measured at 24.10 μg/L and 38.91 μg/dL for subjects (n = 563) in the HEA and 1.87 μg/L and 4.46 μg/dL for subjects (n = 589) from the LEA, respectively (P < 0.001). The rate of mortality from all cancers in the HEA was substantially elevated in comparison with the corresponding mortality rate in the LEA for men (rate ratio = 2.13; 95% confidence intervals = 1.63 - 2.77) and women (2.83; 1.91 - 4.19); rates were also significantly elevated compared with the rate when compared to the entire Wengyuan County area, or the provincial reference population. In addition, mortality rates were significantly increased for stomach, lung and esophageal cancer in the HEA in comparison with the corresponding rates in the LEA, in Wengyuan County and the provincial reference population for men, women and both combined. Further analysis showed that there were significantly positive correlations between exposure to cadmium and lead and the risk of all-cancers and stomach cancer mortality among women and both sexes, whilst zinc exposure showed no association with the risk of site-specific cancer mortality in the nine villages evaluated. The findings of this study reveal probable associations between long-term environmental exposure to both cadmium and lead and an increased risk of mortality from all cancer, as well as from stomach, esophageal and lung-cancers."
3,"Pain in carcinoma of the stomach: Preliminary report In this paper we have attempted to outline in a general way the important pathways of conduction of pain from, and mechanics of production of pain in, the viscera in the upper part of the abdomen. The general principles involved follow a pattern similar to that encountered in cases of benign lesions of the stomach. We felt that, if gastric carcinoma superficially invades the tissues of the stomach and results in disturbances of its normal mechanics, pain may result. This pain would utilize pathways coursing along the splanchnic vessels. In order to be interpreted as pain, these irregularities in mechanics would require an “adequate” stimulus which, in this case, would be spasm or obstruction. If, on the other hand, the lesion burrows through the gastric wall into the tissues surrounding the organ, pain would be relayed to the spinal cord over the spinal sensory group of nerves and, in this instance, wide distribution and reference of pain may be produced. If the lesion invades the regions of the distribution of the phrenic nerve, pain will be referred into the left side of the thorax and to the “peripheral distribution” of this nerve which would be into the left shoulder and the base of the neck. Such a lesion is usually inoperable. Any stimulus which would initiate the sensation of pain on surfaces of the body also could produce pain in penetrating lesions. Applying these hypotheses to the problem of pain in cases of cancer of the stomach permits an explanation of the apparent paradoxical behavior of distress among patients harboring such lesions. Who, at operation or necropsy has not viewed with surprise tremendous cancers involving most of the stomach which have produced no pain whatsoever? After all, this should be no more the cause of astonishment than to witness surgical procedures on the stomach which caused patients no pain even though only local anesthesia was used. The mechanisms which produce pain in such cases depend on the production of an adequate stimulus, such as stretching or constriction of the circular muscular fibers which would require a mechanical disturbance, such as spasm or obstruction. If cancer does not set in motion this adequate stimulus, it is likely to produce no pain whatsoever. If, on the other hand, there is mechanical disturbance such as interference with normal emptying or invasion of the pylorus, pain or at least a sense of epigastric distress is likely to be one of the earlier manifestations of this disease."
3,"Malignant Gastrocolic Fistula as a Late Complication of Radiation Therapy Malignant gastrocolic fistula is a rare mode of presentation of gastric or colonic carcinoma [1–3]. A benign aetiology is more common, including peptic ulcer disease, particularly benign gastric ulcers which may relate to non-steroidal antiinflammatory use. Other benign causes include inflammatory bowel disease, post-PEG insertion, post-gastroenterostomy, pancreatitis, abdominal tuberculosis, trauma, perforated diverticular disease and infections including CMV, histoplasmosis, actinomycosis, amoebiasis, echinococcosis and lymphogranuloma venereum [2, 4–7]. A malignant gastrocolic fistula is most commonly found between the greater curvature of the stomach and the distal half of the transverse colon [8]. They are usually seen in the setting of large infiltrative tumours with a surrounding inflammatory reaction, and lymph node involvement is uncommon [8]. The colon rather than the stomach is the more usual site of origin. In a review of 1,500 cases of stomach cancer and 3,200 cases of colon cancer at the Lahey Clinic, 11 cases of gastrocolic fistula were reported, with 10 being of colonic origin [9]. Radiation therapy is associated with an increased risk of second cancers. Abdominal radiation therapy has been most frequently administered in the context of testicular cancer, where the overall cure rate is greater than 90 % [10]. The average age of presentation of testicular cancer is 35, and second neoplasms are uncommon but well-recognised complications where radiation therapy has been given [11–14]. Exposure to radiation may induce a broad variety of DNA damage including singleand double-stranded DNA breaks, cross-linking and damage to nucleotide bases [15]. Radiation-related genomic instability enhances the rate at which mutations and epigenetic changes are acquired in the descendants of that cell line after many generations of replication. In a cohort study of 40, 576 survivors of testicular cancer, Travis et al. reported on 2,285 second solid tumours observed where 1,619 new cancers were expected, demonstrating an elevated relative risk (ERR) as well as an excess absolute risk of developing a second neoplasm in comparison with the general population [16]. A further report of 5,142 patients treated with radiation therapy describes a 3.4fold increased risk of stomach cancer in survivors of testicular cancer and Hodgkin’s lymphoma [17]. This study found that the risk of second cancer begins approximately 10– 15 years after the original cancer diagnosis. We report herein a case of an adenocarcinoma presenting acutely as a J.

3,"Cancer incidence in England and Wales and New Zealand and in migrants between the two countries. Risks of cancer incidence in people born in England and Wales and New Zealand (non-Maoris) living in their home countries, and after migration between the two countries, were analysed using data from their national cancer registries. Since these populations are of similar genetic origin, any real differences in cancer incidence between them are likely to reflect the action of environmental or behavioural risk factors. The greatest differences in risk between the countries were for cutaneous melanoma and lip cancer. In each sex, relative risks of these malignancies were 4 or greater for the New Zealand-born in New Zealand compared with English and Welsh natives in their home country, and risks for migrants in each direction were generally intermediate between those born in the home country in the two countries. Sizeable significantly raised risks in the New Zealand-born in New Zealand compared with English and Welsh natives in England and Wales also occurred for cancers of the mouth, small intestine, colon, thymus, eye and thyroid, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in each sex, and for cancer of the prostate. For all of these sites except mouth, small intestine and colon there were also risks around or above New Zealand-born levels for English and Welsh migrants to New Zealand; for colon cancer these migrants had risks close to those in England and Wales. New Zealand migrants to England and Wales had risks of cancers of the colon and prostate that were similar to or above New Zealand levels. Risks of cancers of the stomach, lung, pleura and bladder, and Hodgkin's disease in each sex, and cancers of the cervix, ovary and scrotum and penis, were substantially and significantly lower in the New Zealand-born living in New Zealand than in English and Welsh natives in England and Wales. In English and Welsh migrants to New Zealand risks of bladder cancer in each sex, and of scrotal and penile and pleural cancer in males, approximated to England and Wales risks; cervical cancer risk approximated to the New Zealand risk; and stomach, lung and ovarian cancers showed intermediate risks. Migrants from New Zealand to England and Wales did not gain the lung cancer or clearly the stomach cancer risk of their host country, but did have bladder cancer risks approximating to those in England and Wales.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
3,"Identification of HDAC9 as a viable therapeutic target for the treatment of gastric cancer. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACis) are a new class of anticancer drugs confirmed to have good therapeutic effects against gastric cancer (GC) in preclinical experiments, but most HDACis are non-selective (pan-HDACis), with highly toxic side effects. Therefore, it is necessary to screen HDAC family members that play key roles in GC as therapeutic targets to reduce toxic side effects. In this study, we evaluated the targeting specificity of the HDACi suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) for GC via fluorescence molecular imaging (FMI). In vitro FMI results showed that SAHA had higher binding affinity for GC cells than for normal gastric cells. In vivo FMI of gastric tumor-bearing mice confirmed that SAHA can be enriched in GC tissues. However, there was also a high-concentration distribution in normal organs such as the stomach and lungs, suggesting potential side effects. In addition, we found that among the HDAC family members, HDAC9 was the most significantly upregulated in GC cells, and we verified this upregulation in GC tissues. Further experiments confirmed that knockdown of HDAC9 inhibits cell growth, reduces colony formation, and induces apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. These results suggest that HDAC9 has an oncogenic role in GC. Moreover, HDAC9 siRNA suppressed GC tumor growth and enhanced the antitumor efficacy of cisplatin in GC treatment by inhibiting the proliferation and inducing the apoptosis of GC cells in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that the development of HDAC9-selective HDACis is a potential approach to improve the efficacy of chemotherapy and reduce systemic toxicity. Inhibiting histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9), a protein that regulates gene expression, reduces stomach cancer cell growth. The efficacy of current treatments for stomach cancer is limited. Although HDACs have emerged as promising therapeutic targets, non-selective HDAC inhibitors can cause severe side effects. Shigang Ding at Peking University Third Hospital in Beijing, China, and colleagues found that human stomach cancer cells have significantly higher levels of HDAC9 than other members of the HDAC family and that high HDAC9 levels are associated with reduced patient survival. Interfering with the production of HDAC9 protein improved the efficacy of the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin in mice with stomach cancer. The authors suggest that selective HDAC9 inhibitors could help to improve the survival of patients with this type of cancer."

3,"Association of Helicobacter Pylori in Carcinoma Stomach at Maharaja Krishna Chandra Gajapat Medical College: A Prospective Study. Introduction Gastric cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the world. The etiology of gastric cancer includes <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection, diet, lifestyle, tobacco, alcohol, and genetic susceptibility. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGIE) is the most effective method for examining the upper gastrointestinal tract as compared to the other examination tools. Objective To study the histopathological finding of upper gastrointestinal endoscopic biopsies and its association with <i>H. pylori</i> in cases of carcinoma stomach. Materials and methods This was a hospital-based observational study carried out in the Department of Surgery, at Maharaja Krushna Chandra Gajapati Medical College, Berhampur, a tertiary care hospital in Eastern India. Study population consisted of 106 patients for a period of 2 years from July 2019 to June 2021, after due consideration of the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Endoscopic location and pathological types of the gastric lesion were noted, and all biopsy specimens were investigated to see the presence of <i>H. pylori</i> by rapid urease test (RUT) and histological examination in the form of Giemsa and H&E stain. Results In the present study of 106 cases, 62 cases (58.49%) were found to be positive for <i>H. Pylori</i> by RUT and 72 cases (67.92%) were positive for <i>H. pylori</i> by smear staining. In histopathological study, 72 cases (67.92%) were of intestinal type of carcinoma and 34 cases (32.07%) were of diffuse type of carcinoma. Smear for <i>H</i> <i>. pylori</i> was positive in 56 cases (77.78%) among the 72 cases of intestinal type of carcinoma stomach. Whereas only 16 cases (47.05%) were found to be smear-positive for <i>H. pylori</i> among the 34 cases of diffuse type of lesion. Irrespective of histological type, <i>H. pylori</i> was positive in 67.92% of patients with carcinoma stomach. This association was statistically significant (p<0.001) and indicates its role in intestinal type of gastric carcinoma. Conclusion There is a high frequency of <i>H. pylori</i> infection in cases of stomach cancer. This study confirmed the higher association of <i>H. pylori</i> infection with gastric cancer. Its association with the intestinal histological variety of stomach cancer is more common than diffuse type. The prevalence of <i>H. pylori</i> infection in distal stomach carcinoma is higher than proximal."
3,"Endoscopic evaluation of the remnant stomach after gastrectomy: proposal for a new classification. Conclusion. The classification (RGB classification: Residue, Gastritis, Bile) can be used easily and is practical. The results suggest some important differences among methods of recon- struction. This classification seems to be useful to describe these findings and to further evaluate these reconstructive methods. Abstract Background. In Japan, approximately half of gastric cancers are diagnosed in the early stage. Longer survival has been provided for patients with early gastric cancer (EGC). Several new surgical procedures have been employed for some EGCs. To compare the functional results of these techniques with those of classic distal gastrectomy, it is important to evaluate the remnant stomach in relation to quality of life (QOL) and secondary cancers. We propose a new endoscopic classifi- cation, regarding several aspects of the remnant stomach, which enables common understanding and description of the condition. Methods. Of 651 patients who underwent a distal gastrectomy or pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG), 324 had at least one upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy during the follow- up period. Ninety-three of the 324 patients underwent a Roux- en-Y reconstruction (RY); 175, Billroth type 1 (B1); and 56, PPG. Endoscopic findings regarding residual food, gastritis, and bile reflux in the gastric stump were investigated for these patients. We classified the amount of residual food into five grades, the degree and the extent of gastritis into five grades, and bile reflux into two grades. First, we evaluated the consis- tency of diagnosis between two endoscopists, in the first 200 patients, and then we applied the classification to all 324 pa- tients to examine the usefulness of this classification. Results. Consistency of diagnosis was obtained between two endoscopists who classified the patients independently. The agreement rate was 98.5% for residual food, 93% for gastritis, and 100% for bile reflux. Residual food was observed in 14.0% of the RY group, 22.3% of the B1 group, and 37.5% of the PPG group. These differences were significant (RY versus B1; P < 0.05 and RY versus PPG; P < 0.01). The remnant stomach after B1 showed significantly more severe and exten- sive gastritis than that after RY and PPG (P < 0.01). As for bile reflux, there was no significant difference among the three groups."
3,"Effect of E-cadherin on Prognosis of Colorectal Cancer: A Meta-Analysis Update. <AbstractText Label=""PURPOSE"">The effect of E-cadherin on colorectal cancer is still controversial. In order to clarify the effect of E-cadherin on the prognosis and clinicopathological features of colorectal cancer, a meta-analysis was conducted.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were used to collect all relevant literature published before November 2021, and the corresponding data was extracted to analyze the correlation between the expression of E-cadherin and the prognosis and clinicopathological features of colorectal cancer. In addition, the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) was used to validate our results.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">Fifty-two studies, including 9591 patients, were included in this meta-analysis. According to the meta-analysis, low expression of E-cadherin was significantly associated with shorter overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR] 2.09, 95% confidence interval [CI]1.67-2.62; Z = 6.42, p = 0.000) and disease-free survival (DFS) (HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.71-2.42; Z = 7.95, p = 0.000). In addition, low expression of E-cadherin resulted in higher risk of low differentiation (odds ratio [OR] 0.35, 95% CI 0.25-0.50; p = 0.000), high risk of distant metastasis (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.35-0.58; p = 0.000), high risk of vascular invasion (OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.45-0.83; p = 0.002), higher risk of lymph node metastasis (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.42-0.69; p = 0.000), high risk of lymphatic invasion (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.40-0.80; p = 0.001), high risk of deep infiltration (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.50-0.80; p = 0.000), later TNM stage (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.46-0.78; p = 0.000) and late Dukes' stage (OR 0.35,95% CI 0.25-0.49; p = 0.000), but wasn't associated with tumor size (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.71-1.15; p = 0.406).The results of GEPIA showed that E-cadherin mRNA expression in colorectal cancer tumor tissues and normal tissues had no difference, and had no effect on OS and DFS.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">Although not supported by GEPIA, our meta-analysis provided abundant data to suggest that low expression of E-cadherin is associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer patients and is an important factor influencing adverse clinicopathological features. Therefore, E-cadherin may be used to predict the prognosis of colorectal cancer and provide guidance for clinical treatment.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2022.

3,"Critical review of the epidemiology literature on the potential cancer risks of methyl methacrylate. Objective: To critically review and summarise all of the available epidemiological evidence, both published and unpublished, to date on the carcinogenicity of methyl methacrylate (MMA) to humans. Methods: The review focused on studies of cast acrylic sheet manufacturing workers because this industry has historically had a potential for exposure to high levels of MMA. The majority of papers for review were identified through Medline (National Library of Medicine) but there is some discussion of two cohort studies and a nested case–control study, which to date have not been published. Results: An increased risk of colorectal cancer was reported in one group of workers highly exposed to MMA and ethyl acrylate (EA) in the manufacture of acrylic sheet. Analysis of colon cancer by cumulative exposure to MMA indicated that the excess was largely confined to the group with the highest exposure. However, a large excess of colon cancer deaths occurred among workers who never worked in a job entailing more than minimal exposure. Studies of other large occupational cohorts of workers potentially exposed to MMA, including some with potentially comparable exposures, have failed to strengthen the evidence that there is a causal association between colorectal cancer and MMA exposure although one reported an excess that did not appear to be exposure-related. Excesses of cancers of the respiratory system and stomach were seen in some cohorts, but not among the acrylic sheet workers who had the increased risk of colorectal cancer. Conclusions: Excesses of respiratory, stomach and colorectal cancers were observed in some cohorts of workers exposed to MMA. There was little to suggest that MMA exposure was responsible for the excesses of respiratory and stomach cancer and it is more likely that they resulted from unexplained contributions of lifestyle exposures such as cigarette smoking and diet. An excess of colorectal cancer in one group of workers exposed to high levels of MMA and EA during the 1930s and 1940s remains unexplained. However, the lack of consistency in the results of various studies, the absence of dose response and the lack of support from animal toxicology do not provide persuasive evidence that exposure to MMA is a human carcinogen."
3,"Cancer incidence in eastern Morocco: cancer patterns and incidence trends, 2005–2012 Cancer is one of the major health problems worldwide. In this article, we present for the first time the cancer incidence trends, the distribution and the socioeconomic profile of incident cancer cases in Eastern Morocco over a period of eight years. Retrospective descriptive study of patients diagnosed with cancer at the Hassan II Regional Oncology Center (ROC) since it was created in October 2005 until December 2012. During the study period, the ROC was the only hospital specialized in cancer care in Eastern Morocco. A total of 7872 incident cases of cancer were registered in Eastern Morocco. Among these incident cases 5220 cases were women and 2652 were men, with a female to male ratio of 1.97. The mean age at diagnosis was 58 years for males and 52 for females and 94% of the patients aged over 30 years. For both sexes combined and for all cancer sites, breast cancer was the commonest followed by cervix uteri, colon-rectum, lung, nasopharynx, and stomach cancers. The most common cancer in women was breast cancer, followed respectively by cervix uteri cancer, colon-rectum cancer, ovary cancer, and stomach cancer. In men, the lung cancer ranked first, followed respectively by colon-rectum cancer, nasopharynx cancer, prostate cancer, and stomach cancer. For most cancers, crude incidence rates (CR) have increased significantly. The CR for all cancers combined has increased from 56.6 to 80.3 per 100,000 females and from 32.3 to 42.6 per 100,000 males during the study period. Patients profile analysis showed that 79% of cancer patients were from urban areas, 83% were unemployed and 85% had no health insurance. The distribution of cancers in Eastern Morocco is different from those observed in other regions of Morocco. Unlike most countries, women were much more affected with cancer than men in Eastern Morocco. More importantly, the rates of many cancers are rising. Therefore, our data justify the need to develop effective programs for cancer control and prevention in Eastern Morocco. A better access to cancer care should be a priority of the health policies, given that the majority of cancer patients in Eastern Morocco are unemployed, and do not have medical care coverage."
3,"A retrospective cohort study of patients with stomach and liver cancers: the impact of comorbidity and ethnicity on cancer care and outcomes. Background: Comorbidity has an adverse impact on cancer survival partly through its negative impact on receipt of curative treatment. Comorbidity is unevenly distributed within populations, with some ethnic and socioeconomic groups having considerably higher burden. The aim of this study was to investigate the inter-relationships between comorbidity, ethnicity, receipt of treatment, and cancer survival among patients with stomach and liver cancer in New Zealand. Methods: Using the New Zealand Cancer Registry, Māori patients diagnosed with stomach and liver cancers were identified (n = 269), and compared with a randomly selected group of non-Māori patients (n = 255). Clinical and outcome data were collected from medical records, and the administrative hospitalisation and mortality databases. Logistic and Cox regression modelling with multivariable adjustment were used to examine the impacts of ethnicity and comorbidity on receipt of treatment, and the impact of these variables on all-cause and cancer specific survival. Results: More than 70% of patients had died by two years post-diagnosis. As comorbidity burden increased among those with Stage I-III disease, the likelihood that the patient would receive curative surgery decreased (e.g. C3 Index score 6 vs 0, adjusted OR: 0.32, 95% CI 0.13-0.78) and risk of mortality increased (e.g. C3 Index score 6 vs 0, adjusted all-cause HR: 1.44, 95% CI 0.93-2.23). Receipt of curative surgery reduced this excess mortality, in some cases substantially; but the extent to which this occurred varied by level of comorbidity. Māori patients had somewhat higher levels of comorbidity (34% in highest comorbidity category compared with 23% for non-Māori) and poorer survival that was not explained by age, sex, site, stage, comorbidity or receipt of curative surgery (adjusted cancer-specific HR: 1.36, 95% CI 0.97-1.90; adjusted all-cause HR: 1.33, 95% CI 0.97-1.82). Access to healthcare factors accounted for 25-36% of this survival difference. Conclusions: Patients with comorbidity were substantially less likely to receive curative surgery and more likely to die than those without comorbidity. Receipt of curative surgery markedly reduced their excess mortality. Despite no discernible difference in likelihood of curative treatment receipt, Māori remained more likely to die than non-Māori even after adjusting for confounding and mediating variables."
3,"Perception of cancer in patients diagnosed with the most common gastrointestinal cancers Gastrointestinal cancers, including colorectal cancer, stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer are among the most common cancers in Poland. Cancer patients usually assess their quality of life much worse than the general population, while negative emotions associated with the illness may affect the results of treatment. The study involved 378 patients with colorectal cancer, stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer, treated as outpatients at the Oncology Center - Maria Sklodowska-Curie Institute in Warsaw in 2013–2018. Standardized tools were used in the study: the Beliefs about Pain Control Questionnaire (BPCQ), the Pain Coping Strategies Questionnaire (CSQ), Approval Illness Scale (AIS), Mental Adjustment to Cancer (MiniMAC). The main goal of the study was to assess pain control, pain management strategies, illness acceptance and adaptation to cancer in patients with the most common gastrointestinal cancers. Patients with gastrointestinal cancers ascribe the greatest role in controlling pain to internal factors (M = 16.84, SE = .34), and the highest score in this area was obtained by patients with colorectal cancer (M = 17.33, SE = .35). The most frequently chosen strategy is declaring coping (M = 20.95, SE = .57), although patients with pancreatic cancer obtained a high score also in the area of catastrophizing (M = 17.99, SE = 1.14). The average value of illness acceptance for patients with gastrointestinal cancers was M = 25.00 (SE = .50) and it was the lowest in the group of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer (M = 23.41, SE = 1.16), and the highest in a group of people with colorectal cancer (M = 27.76, SE = .51). Patients with gastrointestinal cancers obtained the highest values of the MiniMAC test in the area of the fighting spirit (M = 21.30, SE = .25), characteristic mainly for patients with colorectal cancer. Patients with pancreatic cancer were characterized by high anxiety and helplessness/hopelessness. Patients with gastrointestinal cancers use different methods of pain control and pain coping strategies, with active behaviors being preferred by patients with colorectal cancer and destructive - by patients with pancreatic cancer. The majority of socio-economic variables, as well as the treatment method, affect the patients’ behaviors."
3,"Induction of chromosome instability and stomach cancer by altering the expression pattern of mitotic checkpoint genes in mice exposed to areca-nut There are strong indications for a causal association between areca-nut consumption and cancers. In Meghalaya, India, the variety of areca-nut is used as raw and unprocessed form whose chemical composition and pharmacological actions have been reported. Yet we know little on the initial pathway involved in areca-nut associated carcinogenesis since it is difficult to assess its effects on genetic alterations without interference of other compounding factors. Therefore, present study was undertaken in mice to verify the ability of raw areca-nut (RAN) to induce cancer and to monitor the expression of certain genes involved in carcinogenesis. This study was not intended to isolate any active ingredients from the RAN and to look its action. Three groups of mice (n = 25 in each) were taken and used at different time-points for different experimental analysis. The other three groups of mice (n = 15 in each) were considered for tumor induction studies. In each set, two groups were administered RAN-extract ad libitum in drinking water with or without lime. The expression of certain genes was assessed by conventional RT-PCR and immunoblotting. The mice were given the whole RAN-extract with and without lime in order to mimic the human consumption style of RAN. Histological preparation of stomach tissue revealed that RAN induced stomach cancer. A gradual increase in the frequency of precocious anaphase and aneuploid cells was observed in the bone marrow cells with a greater increment following RAN + lime administeration. Levels of p53, Bax, Securin and p65 in esophageal and stomach cells were elevated during early days of RAN exposure while those of different mitotic checkpoint proteins were downregulated. Apoptotic cell death was detected in non-cancerous stomach cells but not in tumor cells which showed overexpression of Bax and absence of PARP. Present study suggested (a) RAN induces stomach cancer, however, presence of lime promoted higher cell transformation and thereby developed cancer earlier, (b) perturbations in components of the chromosome segregation machinery could be involved in the initial process of carcinogenicity and (c) the importance of precocious anaphase as a screening marker for identification of mitotic checkpoint defects during early days."

3,"Reanalysis of cancer mortality in Japanese A-bomb survivors exposed to low doses of radiation: bootstrap and simulation methods The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) recommended annual occupational dose limit is 20 mSv. Cancer mortality in Japanese A-bomb survivors exposed to less than 20 mSv external radiation in 1945 was analysed previously, using a latency model with non-linear dose response. Questions were raised regarding statistical inference with this model. Cancers with over 100 deaths in the 0 - 20 mSv subcohort of the 1950-1990 Life Span Study are analysed with Poisson regression models incorporating latency, allowing linear and non-linear dose response. Bootstrap percentile and Bias-corrected accelerated (BCa) methods and simulation of the Likelihood Ratio Test lead to Confidence Intervals for Excess Relative Risk (ERR) and tests against the linear model. The linear model shows significant large, positive values of ERR for liver and urinary cancers at latencies from 37 - 43 years. Dose response below 20 mSv is strongly non-linear at the optimal latencies for the stomach (11.89 years), liver (36.9), lung (13.6), leukaemia (23.66), and pancreas (11.86) and across broad latency ranges. Confidence Intervals for ERR are comparable using Bootstrap and Likelihood Ratio Test methods and BCa 95% Confidence Intervals are strictly positive across latency ranges for all 5 cancers. Similar risk estimates for 10 mSv (lagged dose) are obtained from the 0 - 20 mSv and 5 - 500 mSv data for the stomach, liver, lung and leukaemia. Dose response for the latter 3 cancers is significantly non-linear in the 5 - 500 mSv range. Liver and urinary cancer mortality risk is significantly raised using a latency model with linear dose response. A non-linear model is strongly superior for the stomach, liver, lung, pancreas and leukaemia. Bootstrap and Likelihood-based confidence intervals are broadly comparable and ERR is strictly positive by bootstrap methods for all 5 cancers. Except for the pancreas, similar estimates of latency and risk from 10 mSv are obtained from the 0 - 20 mSv and 5 - 500 mSv subcohorts. Large and significant cancer risks for Japanese survivors exposed to less than 20 mSv external radiation from the atomic bombs in 1945 cast doubt on the ICRP recommended annual occupational dose limit."
3,"Frequent loss of RUNX3 gene expression in remnant stomach cancer and adjacent mucosa with special reference to topography Our previous studies suggest that a lack of RUNX3 function is causally related to the genesis and progression of human gastric cancer. This study was conducted to determine whether alteration of RUNX3 gene expression could be detected in the normal-looking gastric remnant mucosa, and to ascertain any difference in the potential of gastric carcinogenesis between the anastomotic site and other areas in the remnant stomach after distal gastrectomy for peptic ulcer (RB group) or gastric cancer (RM group), by analysing RUNX3 expression with special reference to topography. A total of 89 patients underwent distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer from the intact stomach (GCI group) and 58 patients underwent resection of the remnant stomach for gastric cancer (RB group: 34 cases, RM group: 24 cases). We detected RUNX3 and gene promoter methylation by in situ hybridisation, quantitative reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR), and methylation-specific PCR. The interval between the initial surgery and surgery for remnant gastric cancer (interval time) was 10.4 years in the RM group, and 27.5 years in the RB group. Cancers in the RB group were significantly more predominant in the anastomosis area (P<0.05). Within the tumour, downregulation of RUNX3 expression ranged from 74.7 to 85.7% in the three groups. The rate of downregulation of RUNX3 of adjacent mucosa was 39.2% (11 in 28 cases) in RB and 47.6% (10 in 21 cases) in RM, which are significantly higher than that of the GCI group (19.5%, 17 in 87 cases). In noncancerous mucosa of the remnant stomach in the RB group, RUNX3 expression decreased more near the anastomosis area. In the RM group, however, there were no significant differences in RUNX3 expression by sampling location. Based on RUNX3 downregulation and clinical features, residual stomach mucosa of the RM group would have a higher potential of gastric carcinogenesis compared to the RB or GCI group. Gastric stump mucosa of the RB group has higher potential especially than other areas of residual stomach mucosa. Measurement of RUNX3 expression and detection of RUNX3 methylation in remnant gastric mucosa may estimate the forward risk of carcinogenesis in the remnant stomach."

3,"Cancer incidence in Arkhangelskaja Oblast in northwestern Russia. The Arkhangelsk Cancer Registry Data concerning incidence and prevalence of cancer in the different regions of Russia have traditionally not been provided on a basis that facilitated comparison with data from countries in western parts of Europe. The oncological hospital in Arkhangelsk, in co-operation with Universitetet i Tromso (Norway), has established a population based cancer registry for Arkhangelskaja Oblast (AO). AO is an administrative unit with 1.3 million inhabitants in northwestern Russia. The aim of this investigation was to assess the content and quality of the AO cancer registry (AKR), and to present the site-specific cancer-incidence rates in AO in the period 1993–2001. The population in this study consisted of all individuals registered as residents of AO. All new cancer cases in the period 1993 – 2001, registered the AKR, were included in the study (ICD-10: C00-C95, except for C77-78). The annual gender and age-group-specific population figures were obtained from the AO statistics office. A total of 34 697 cases of primary cancers were included. The age-adjusted (world standard) incidence rate for all sites combined was 164/100 000 for women and 281/100 000 for men. The highest incidence was for cancer of the trachea, bronchus and lung (16.3% of all cases), whereof 88.6 % of the cases were among men. Among women, cancer of the breast constituted 15.9 percent of all cases. The age-adjusted incidences of the most frequent cancer sites among men were: lung (77.4/100 000); stomach (45.9); rectum (13.4); oesophagus (13.0); colon (12.2); bladder (11.6); and prostate cancer (11.1). Among women they were: breast (28.5); stomach (19.7); colon (12.2); and ovary cancer (9.0). Our findings confirm and strengthen the indication that the incidences of stomach, larynx, liver, pancreas, prostate, colon, bladder and melanoma cancer are quite different in male populations in Russia compared to many other European countries. Among women, most major cancer types, except stomach, appear to be relatively low in Russian populations. The AKR provides quality data for estimations and insight to the cancer incidence in a northern Russian population, and we consider the reported incidence rates to reflect the cancer situation in AO well."

In 2021, colorectal cancer in AYA accounted for 70,201 incidences, 26,222 deaths, and 1,538,837 DALYs worldwide. In contrast, esophageal and stomach cancer had lower burdens in 8,164 and 42,039 incidences, respectively. While the incidence and death rates of esophageal and stomach cancers have declined, colorectal cancer have shown a significant increase in AYA. The age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of colorectal cancer correlates positively with SDI. In AYA, level 2 risk factors for colorectal cancer include alcohol use, dietary risks, high body mass index, high fasting plasma glucose, low physical activity, and tobacco. For esophageal cancer, the risk factors are alcohol use, dietary risks, and tobacco, and for stomach are dietary risks and tobacco.

3,"SEREX analysis of gastric cancer antigens Stomach cancer is the major malignancy in Japan and one of the most common cancers worldwide. To establish the basis for an immunotherapeutic approach to stomach cancer, we have initiated an analysis of stomach cancer antigens recognized by human immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies using SE-REX, a powerful expression cloning method developed by Dr. M. Pfreundschuh's group. Five stomach cancer cDNA libraries have been screened with autologous patient sera: one moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma; two poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas; and two scirrhous-type poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas of Borrmann type 4, the most devastating form of stomach cancer. Based on the reactivities of clones with autologous IgG antibodies, an average of 50 independent clones from each library and a total of 297 clones were isolated. DNA sequencing revealed that these 297 clones were derived from 136 different genes. Comparison of the 136 genes to sequences in DNA databases showed that 95 are previously identified genes and 41 are newly identified in this study. The antigens are derived from various genes including a chimeric gene between E-cadherin and an unknown gene Y, AKT oncogene, genes overexpressed in stomach cancers, genes of which the transcripts are alternatively or aberrantly spliced, and genes known to be involved in autoimmune diseases. Thus stomach cancer patients can generate an immune response against a surprisingly diverse set of gene products. To identify antigens potentially useful in the diagnosis and therapy of gastric cancer, all 136 genes were tested for their reactivities with a panel of sera from 44 gastric cancer patients (17 women and 27 men, aged 35-81 years) and with a panel of sera from 100 control individuals with no previous history of cancer but some of whom had gastritis (55 women and 45 men, aged 30-69 years). Eleven antigens showed reactivity only with a certain proportion of cancer patient sera but not with any control sera. An additional 12 antigens elicited antibody production at a much higher frequency in cancer patients than in control individuals. To evaluate the clinical usefulness of these antigens we are now examining their expression in normal and malignant tissues."
3,"Dietary preference, physical activity, and cancer risk in men: national health insurance corporation study The effects of vegetable preference and leisure-time physical activity (LPA) on cancer have been inconsistent. We examined the effects of dietary preference and physical activity, as well as their combined effect on cancer risk. This prospective cohort study included 444,963 men, older than 40 years, who participated in a national health examination program begun in 1996. Based on the answer to the question ""What kind of dietary preference do you have?"" we categorized dietary preference as (1) vegetables, (2) mixture of vegetables and meat, and (3) meats. We categorized LPA as low (< 4 times/wk, < 30 min/session), moderate (2–4 times/wk, ≥ 30 min/session or ≥ 5 times/wk, < 30 min/session), or high (≥ 5 times/wk, ≥ 30 min/session). We obtained cancer incidence data for 1996 through 2002 from the Korean Central Cancer Registry. We used a standard Poisson regression model with a log link function and person-time offset to estimate incidence and relative risk.. During the 6-year follow-up period, we identified 14,109 cancer cases. Multivariate analysis revealed that a preference for vegetables or a mixture of vegetables and meat as opposed to a preference for meat played a significant protective role against lung cancer incidence (aRR, 0.81; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68–0.98). Compared with the low LPA group, subjects with moderate-high LPA had a significantly lower risk for stomach (aRR, 0.91; 95%CI, 0.86–0.98), lung (aRR, 0.83; 95%CI, 0.75–0.92), and liver (aRR, 0.88; 95%CI, 0.81–0.95) cancer. Among current smokers, the combined moderate-high LPA and vegetable or mixture of vegetables and meat preference group showed a 40% reduced risk of lung cancer (aRR, 0.60; 95%CI, 0.47–0.76) compared with the combined low LPA and meat preference group. Among never/former smokers, subjects with moderate-high LPA and a preference for vegetables or a mixture of vegetables and meat showed reduced stomach cancer risk (aRR, 0.72; 95%CI, 0.54–0.95). Our findings add to the evidence of the beneficial effects of vegetable preference on lung cancer risk and of physical activity on lung, stomach, and liver cancer risk. Additionally, vegetable preference combined with LPA might significantly reduce lung and stomach cancer risk."
3,"Occupational exposure to diesel engine emissions and risk of cancer in Swedish men and women. Objective: To investigate the risk of cancer among workers exposed to diesel emissions in a large record-linkage study from Sweden. Methods: The Swedish Cancer Environment Register III contains nationwide data on cancer incidence during 1971–1989, by occupation and industry of employment as reported in the 1960 and 1970 censuses. After excluding farmers, we classified job and industry titles according to estimated probability and intensity of exposure to diesel emissions. Exposed men in the 1960 census contributed over 7,400,000 person-years, and exposed women contributed over 240,000. We compared them to the remainder of the employed population, using indirect standardization and multivariate Poisson regression analysis. Results: Men exposed in the 1960 census experienced an increased risk of lung cancer: the relative risks (RRs) were 0.95 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9–1.0), 1.1 (1.1–1.2) and 1.3 (1.3–1.4) for low, medium, and high intensity of exposure. Corresponding results for probability of exposure were 1.1 (1.0–1.1), 0.9 (0.86–0.94) and 1.2 (1.1–1.2). The risk was higher for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung than for other histological types. Results in women were not suggestive of an effect (RR in the category of medium or high intensity of exposure 1.1, 95% CI 0.6–1.8). A small but significant increase in risk of cancers of the stomach (SIR 1.06), pancreas (SIR 1.05), larynx (SIR 1.09), and the kidney (SIR 1.06) was present among men exposed to diesel emissions, without a clear trend according to either probability or intensity of exposure. The SIR among women was non-significantly increased for stomach, pancreatic, and laryngeal cancers, but not for kidney cancer. Furthermore, a significantly increased risk of oral/pharyngeal (SIR 1.64) and cervical (SIR 1.48) cancers was present among women, with a suggestion of a dose–response relationship. There was no increased risk of bladder cancer in either gender. Conclusions: The results of this study provide evidence of a positive exposure–response relationship between exposure to diesel emissions and lung cancer risk among men. The positive results for other neoplasms, such as stomach, pancreatic, oral/pharyngeal, and cervical cancers, cannot be attributed to diesel exposure, but they deserve attention in future investigations."
3,"Value of the dynamic and delayed MR sequence with Gd-DTPA in the T- staging of stomach cancer: Correlation with the histopathology Background: To evaluate the usefulness of dynamic and delayed magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the T-staging of stomach cancer and to compare the enhancement pattern of the cancerous lesion and the normal wall. ; Methods: We performed MR imaging in 46 patients with stomach cancer (including four early gastric cancers and 42 advanced gastric cancers). Axial, sagittal, or coronal two-dimensional fast low-angle shot) MR images for the water-distended stomach were obtained with dynamic protocol, including precontrast images and images obtained 30, 60, 90, and 240–300 s after intravenous injection of the 0.1 mM Gd-DTPA/kg solution. We evaluated the thickness, interruption (or not) of the low signal intensity bands, and enhancement pattern of the cancerous wall and normal gastric wall. We prospectively evaluated the depth of cancer invasion, perigastric infiltration (extraserosal invasion), perigastric organ invasion, and regional lymph nodes and determined tumor staging on MR images. These MR evaluations including MR-determined staging were correlated with the surgicopathologic findings. ; Results: Stomach cancer was shown as having a thickened wall with a rapid enhancing pattern after intravenous Gd-DTPA administration. The mucosa (and/or submucosa) affected by stomach cancer showed an early enhancement pattern (30–90 s after Gd-DTPA administration) in 43 of 46 patients (93%). The normal gastric mucosa demonstrated a delayed peak enhancement pattern (>90 s after Gd-DTPA administration) in 29 of 46 patients (63%) and variable enhancement pattern in 17 of 46 patients (37%). An interrupted low signal intensity band or highly enhanced tumorous lesion penetrating through the gastric wall was seen in 17 of 19 pT3 patients (90%). Consistency between MR-determined staging and surgicopathologic staging occurred in three of four pT1 tumors (75%), 10 of 13 pT2 tumors (77%), 17 of 19 pT3 tumors (90%), and eight of 10 pT4 tumors (80%); overall accuracy was 83%. Overall accuracy of regional lymph node involvement, as determined by enhanced MR, was 52%; 24 of 46 node groups were positive. ; Conclusions: Dynamic and delayed MR imaging can be useful for predicting depth of cancer invasion, perigastric infiltration (extraserosal invasion), and perigastric organ invasion by gastric cancer."
3,"A rare case of PSA-negative metastasized prostate cancer to the stomach with serum CEA and CA19-9 elevation: a case report Metastatic cancer to the stomach is relatively rare. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a reliable biomarker used in the screening and management of patients with prostate cancer. However, it is difficult to definitively diagnose a PSA-negative metastatic gastric tumor of prostate cancer because the cancer sometimes resembles primary gastric cancer in clinical images. It is also difficult to distinguish metastatic cancer from primary cancer even in the pathological examination of biopsy samples when the lesion is poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. There is a possibility that the characteristics of the cancer are changed during treatment such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Therefore, careful consideration is required for surgical indication. A 60-year-old male underwent radical prostatectomy and subsequent radiation therapy for advanced prostate cancer (pT3N1M0) 10 years previously, and hormone therapy was started for metachronous multiple bone metastasis 10 months before. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed an irregular depressed lesion with a convergence of folds at the greater curvature of the upper gastric body. Biopsy showed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma that was negative for PSA upon immunohistochemistry. He had high serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (946.1 ng/ml) and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) (465.1 U/ml) levels with no elevation of PSA (0.152 ng/ml). The tumor was diagnosed as primary gastric cancer based on the clinical imaging and pathological examination of the biopsy sample including the PSA staining. Based on the diagnosis, laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy was performed. However, pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma that was positive for other prostate markers such as androgen receptor. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with metastasized prostate cancer to the stomach. We report a case of metastatic gastric cancer of prostate cancer 10 years after radical prostatectomy. In the present case, it was difficult to diagnose a metastatic gastric tumor of prostate cancer preoperatively, because of its resemblance to primary gastric cancer without PSA expression and no serum PSA elevation. Although a rare case entity, it is important to consider the possibility of a metastatic gastric tumor when the surgical indication is determined in cases with another co-existing cancer."

3,"Cancer incidence among marine engineers, a population-based study (Iceland). Objectives: Marine engineers are in their occupation exposed to different chemicals, organic solvents, exhaust gases, oils, and petroleum products, and were formerly exposed to asbestos. The aim was to study the cancer pattern, with particular attention to lung and bladder cancer, in an Icelandic cohort of marine engineers, indirectly controlling for their smoking habits. Methods: A cohort of 6603 male marine engineers was followed up from 1955 to 1998, a total of 167,715 person-years. The cohort was record linked by the engineers' personal identification numbers to population-based registers containing the vital and emigration status and cancer diagnosis. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for all cancers and different cancer sites in relation to different lag time and year of graduation. Information on smoking habits was obtained by administering a questionnaire to a sample of the cohort (n = 1501). Results: In the total cohort 810 cancers were observed, whereas 794 were expected (SIR 1.0, 95% CI 1.0–1.1), and significantly increased risk of stomach cancer (SIR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0–1.5) and lung cancer (SIR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0–1.5) was found. Increased risk of all cancers (SIR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1–1.3), stomach cancer (SIR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1–1.9), lung cancer (SIR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2–1.8), pleural mesothelioma (SIR 4.8, 95% CI 1.3–12.3), and urinary bladder cancer (SIR 1.3, 95% CI 1.0–1.8) were observed when a 40-year lag time was applied. The engineers' smoking habits were similar to those in a sample of the general population. The predictive value for lung cancer was 1.03. Conclusions: The increased risk for mesothelioma is possibly attributable to the previous asbestos exposure. The excess of lung cancer could also be related to asbestos exposure. The high incidence of stomach cancer, lung cancer, and bladder cancer may be related to exposure to chemical risk factors, such as oils and petroleum products, as confounding due to smoking seems to be ruled out. In the light of the limited exposure information in the present study the importance of the different occupational exposures needs to be evaluated in further studies."

However, clinical level of FCR was not associated with health promotion and disease prevention behaviors.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">FCR in stomach cancer survivors was associated with social, psychological, and HRQoL factors rather than demographic, socioeconomic, or cancer-related factors.

3,"An age-period-cohort analysis of mortality rates for stomach, colorectal, liver, and lung cancer among prefectures in Japan, 1999–2018 Although change in the birth cohort effect on cancer mortality rates is known to be highly associated with the decreasing rates of age-standardized cancer mortality rates in Japan, the differences in the trends of cohort effect for representative cancer types among the prefectures remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the differences in the decreasing rate of cohort effects among the prefectures for representative cancer types using age-period-cohort (APC) analysis. Data on stomach, colorectal, liver, and lung cancer mortality for each prefecture and the population data from 1999 to 2018 were obtained from the Vital Statistics in Japan. Mortality data for individuals aged 50 to 79 years grouped in 5-year increments were used, and corresponding birth cohorts born 1920–1924 through 1964–1978 were used for analysis. We estimated the effects of age, period, and cohort on each type of mortality rate for each prefecture by sex. Then, we calculated the decreasing rates of cohort effects for each prefecture. We also calculated the mortality rate ratio of each prefecture compared with all of Japan for cohorts using the estimates. As a result of APC analysis, we found that the decreasing rates of period effects were small and that there was a little difference in the decreasing rates among prefectures for all types of cancer among both sexes. On the other hand, there was a large difference in the decreasing rates of cohort effects for stomach and liver cancer mortality rates among prefectures, particularly for men. For men, the decreasing rates of cohort effects in cohorts born between 1920–1924 and 1964–1978 varied among prefectures, ranging from 4.1 to 84.0% for stomach cancer and from 20.2 to 92.4% for liver cancers, respectively. On the other hand, the differences in the decreasing rates of cohort effects among prefectures for colorectal and lung cancer were relatively smaller. The decreasing rates of cohort effects for stomach and liver cancer varied widely among prefectures. It is possible that this will influence cancer mortality rates in each prefecture in the future."
3,"Different regression equations relate age to the incidence of Lauren types 1 and 2 stomach cancer in the SEER database: these equations are unaffected by sex or race Although impacts upon gastric cancer incidence of race, age, sex, and Lauren type have been individually explored, neither their importance when evaluated together nor the presence or absence of interactions among them have not been fully described. This study, derived from SEER (Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program of the National Cancer Institute) data, analyzed the incidences of gastric cancer between the years 1992–2001. There were 7882 patients who had developed gastric cancer. The total denominator population was 145,155, 669 persons (68,395,787 for 1992–1996, 78,759,882 for 1997–2001). Patients with multiple tumors were evaluated as per the default of the SEER*Stat program. 160 age-, five year period (1992–1996 vs 1997–2001)-, sex-, race (Asian vs non-Asian)-, Lauren type- specific incidences were derived to form the stratified sample evaluated by linear regression. (160 groups = 2 five year periods × 2 race groups × 2 sexes × 2 Lauren types × 10 age groups.) Linear regression was used to analyze the importance of each of these explanatory variables and to see if there were interactions among the explanatory variables. Race, sex, age group, and Lauren type were found to be important explanatory variables, as were interactions between Lauren type and each of the other important explanatory variables. In the final model, the contribution of each explanatory variable was highly statistically significant (t > 5, d.f. 151, P < 0.00001). The regression equation for Lauren type 1 had different coefficients for the explanatory variables Race, Sex, and Age, than did the regression equation for Lauren type 2. The change of the incidence of stomach cancer with respect to age for Lauren type 1 stomach cancer differs from that for Lauren type 2 stomach cancers. The relationships between age and Lauren type do not differ across gender or race. The results support the notion that Lauren type 1 and Lauren type 2 gastric cancers have different etiologies and different patterns of progression from pre-cancer to cancer. The results should be validated by evaluation of other databases."
3,"Assessing clinical trial failure risk factors and reasons in gastric cancer. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Gastric cancer is one of the leading cancer-related death causes. Enormous efforts have been focused on this field in these years. However, clinical trial failure is becoming a massive obstacle for researchers to apply their research results for clinical use. This study aimed to analyze the reasons behind clinical failures and identify potential risk factors of clinical trial failures.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">On December, 1, 2021, we queried ClinicalTrials.gov for gastric cancer listed in phase II/III. We included trials specifying their interests in ""stomach cancer"", ""Stomach Neoplasms"", ""Gastric Cancer"", ""Gastric Neoplasms"", ""Gastric Carcinoma"", ""Stomach Carcinoma"", ""Gastroesophageal Junction Cancer"". Exclude criteria are: (1) Trials that start prior to 01/01/2007 and start after 12/01/2020; (2) Trials with ""not yet recruiting"", ""suspended"", ""withdrawn"", or ""unknown"" status; (3) Trials do not provide an anticipated accrual number or a start date.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">A total of 567 trials are included. 10.2% of these trials are failed. 16 (2.82%) were terminated for good reasons, and 42 (7.41%) were terminated for bad reasons. Multi-centre (P-value = 0.088) and anticipated accrual (P-value = 0.099) are potential risk factors for clinical failures in the simple logistic regression model. After considering the interaction between multi-centre and anticipated accrual, the odds ratio of anticipated accrual is 0.60 (P-value = 0.009) in single centre trials. In multi-centre trials, the odds ratio of anticipated accrual is 0.72 (P-value = 0.025). The primary reason for gastric cancer trial terminations is recruitment failure.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">The rate that trials terminated in gastric cancer has decreased compared to previous studies. Comparing to other types of oncology trials, poor accrual continues to be the predominant reason, followed by business or sponsor reasons. Single-center trials with smaller anticipated accrual number are more likely to be terminated which may resulted by limited resources invested to the trial. Single-center design exacerbated the difficulty of participant recruitment. Future studies need to continue tracking the rate of trial termination across oncology and whether the reasons behind them have changed.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2022.

3,"Gene expression analysis of a Helicobacter pylori-infected and high-salt diet-treated mouse gastric tumor model: identification of CD177 as a novel prognostic factor in patients with gastric cancer Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and excessive salt intake are known as important risk factors for stomach cancer in humans. However, interactions of these two factors with gene expression profiles during gastric carcinogenesis remain unclear. In the present study, we investigated the global gene expression associated with stomach carcinogenesis and prognosis of human gastric cancer using a mouse model. To find candidate genes involved in stomach carcinogenesis, we firstly constructed a carcinogen-induced mouse gastric tumor model combined with H. pylori infection and high-salt diet. C57BL/6J mice were given N-methyl-N-nitrosourea in their drinking water and sacrificed after 40 weeks. Animals of a combination group were inoculated with H. pylori and fed a high-salt diet. Gene expression profiles in glandular stomach of the mice were investigated by oligonucleotide microarray. Second, we examined an availability of the candidate gene as prognostic factor for human patients. Immunohistochemical analysis of CD177, one of the up-regulated genes, was performed in human advanced gastric cancer specimens to evaluate the association with prognosis. The multiplicity of gastric tumor in carcinogen-treated mice was significantly increased by combination of H. pylori infection and high-salt diet. In the microarray analysis, 35 and 31 more than two-fold up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively, were detected in the H. pylori-infection and high-salt diet combined group compared with the other groups. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed significant over-expression of two candidate genes including Cd177 and Reg3g. On immunohistochemical analysis of CD177 in human advanced gastric cancer specimens, over-expression was evident in 33 (60.0%) of 55 cases, significantly correlating with a favorable prognosis (P = 0.0294). Multivariate analysis including clinicopathological factors as covariates revealed high expression of CD177 to be an independent prognostic factor for overall survival. These results suggest that our mouse model combined with H. pylori infection and high-salt diet is useful for gene expression profiling in gastric carcinogenesis, providing evidence that CD177 is a novel prognostic factor for stomach cancer. This is the first report showing a prognostic correlation between CD177 expression and solid tumor behavior."
3,"A case of Turcot's syndrome type 1 with loss of immunoexpression of MSH6 in colon cancer and liver metastasis due to secondary somatic mutation in coding mononucleotide (C)8 tract: a case report. Lynch syndrome (LS), which is known as a hereditary cancer syndrome, is distinguished by microsatellite instability, represented by the altered number of repetitive sequences in the coding and/or non-coding region. Immunohistochemical staining (IHC) of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) proteins (e.g., MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2) has been recognized as an useful technique for screening of LS. Previous study has shown that the assessment of IHC, however, requires specific caution due to variable staining patterns even without germline mutations in MMR genes. A 48-year-old man, who had been treated for anaplastic astrocytoma, was referred to our department for the precise examination of progressing anemia. Whole-body examination revealed two advanced carcinomas in descending colon and stomach. A hypo-vascular mass lesion was detected in liver as well. Pathological diagnosis (on surgical specimens) was poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in descending colon, moderately differentiated tubular adenocarcinoma in stomach, and liver metastasis, which is possibly from colon. It was suspected that this case would be Turcot’s syndrome-type-1 due to its specific family history having two cases of colon cancer within the second relatives. Pathogenic frameshift mutations in codon 618 of MLH1 gene was identified. Immunohistochemical analyses (IHC) demonstrated complete loss of MLH1 immuno-expression as well as of PMS2 except for those in brain tumor. Although frameshift mutation was not found in MSH6 gene, histological expression of MSH6 was patchy in primary colon carcinoma and was completely lost in the metastatic site in liver. MSH6 expression in gastric carcinoma, a coincidental cancer in this case, was intact. An abnormal (C)8 region was identified by the cloned PCR of colon and liver tumors but not from gastric cancer. Frameshift mutation in a (C)8 tract in exon 5 of the MSH6 gene was also detected in liver metastasis. This case supports a plausible mechanism, proposed by a previous literature, for the reduced expression of MSH6 in a somatic mutation manner, which might preferentially happen in colon cancer rather than in stomach carcinoma in MLH1/PMS2-deficient type of Turcot’s syndrome type 1."
3,"Stage of cancer diagnoses among migrants from the former Soviet Union in comparison to the German population – are diagnoses among migrants delayed? In this study, we compared stage at diagnosis, standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of most frequent cancer diagnoses between re-settlers (Aussiedler) from the former Soviet Union and the general population in the Saarland in Germany to assess possible delays in diagnosis of cancer among this migrant group. Lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, malignant melanoma of the skin and stomach cancer diagnoses among a cohort of 18,619 re-settlers living in the Saarland between 1990 and 2009 were identified by the federal state’s cancer registry. Vital status was available for the respective time-period and used to calculate SIR and SMR in comparison to the autochthonous population. Tumor stages were condensed into local and advanced stages. Odds ratios (OR) for an advanced tumor stage were modeled in dependence of re-settler-status and relevant covariates by logistic regression. Missing values were addressed in a sensitivity analysis. The influence of duration of stay in Germany on advanced stage diagnosis was analyzed among re-settlers. SIR and SMR of lung and breast cancer were lower among female re-settlers, while SIR and SMR of colorectal and prostate cancer were lower among male re-settlers. SIR and SMR of stomach cancer were elevated among both sexes. Female re-settlers showed an elevated OR for being diagnosed with advanced stage breast cancer. Both male and female re-settlers showed an elevated OR when observing all six sites combined (OR among males 1.47, p = 0.04; OR among females 1.37, p = 0.05). The result of elevated ORs was supported in the sensitivity analysis. Finally, male re-settlers showed a weak association between duration of stay in Germany and reduced risk for advanced stage diagnosis. Re-settlers were more likely to be diagnosed at an advanced tumor stage. These findings are in line with previous research having shown unfavorable health care utilization of re-settlers. Overall, low mortality rates despite an increased risk of advanced stage at diagnosis argue for a sufficient follow-up care, comparable to the autochthonous population."
3,"Amputation neuroma mimicking lymph node metastasis of remnant gastric cancer: a case report. Amputation neuromas (ANs) are reactive hyperplasia of nerve tissues that occur after a trauma or surgery involving the peripheral nerves. Only two previous reports of ANs occurring around the stomach and post gastrectomy have been reported. We report the case of a patient with AN near the remnant stomach who underwent distal gastrectomy for gastric cancer. A 76-year-old man underwent distal gastrectomy, D1+ lymphadenectomy, and Billroth-I reconstruction for early gastric cancer in another hospital at 63 years of age. A regular gastrointestinal endoscopic follow-up examination after gastrectomy revealed an ulcerative lesion on the lesser curvature of the remnant stomach, which was diagnosed as remnant gastric cancer based on the histopathological examination. Then, he was transferred to our hospital. An upper gastrointestinal series and endoscopy revealed an 18-mm Type 0-IIc lesion on the lesser curvature of the remnant stomach with an estimated depth within the mucosa (T1a). An abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) failed to detect the primary lesion; however, a slightly enhanced 13 × 10-mm nodule was detected near the lesser curvature of the remnant stomach. An endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) of the nodule showed no cancer cell; thus, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for the remnant gastric cancer was performed. Histopathological examination revealed noncurative resection due to T1b2 and UL (+). We planned an additional surgical resection. Before the resection, CT was performed, which had a 3-month interval with a previous CT, showing an enlargement of the nodule to 16 × 12 mm. We diagnosed the nodule as a lymph node metastasis and performed resection of the remnant stomach, D2 lymphadenectomy, splenectomy, and Roux-en-Y reconstruction. The nodule was later diagnosed as AN based on the histopathological examination. There was no residual cancer in the resected specimen. We report AN mimicking lymph node metastasis near the remnant stomach of a patient with remnant gastric cancer. When nodules appear in the previous operative field, the possibility of ANs should be considered, although the incidence may be quite low."
3,"Stomach microbiota, Helicobacter pylori, and group 2 innate lymphoid cells. The stomach has been thought to host few commensal bacteria because of the existence of barriers, such as gastric acid. However, recent culture-independent, sequencing-based microbial analysis has shown that the stomach also harbors a wide diversity of microbiota. Although the stomach immune system, especially innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), has not been well elucidated, recent studies have shown that group 2 ILCs (ILC2s) are the dominant subtype in the stomach of both humans and mice. Stomach ILC2s are unique in that their existence is dependent on stomach microbiota, in sharp contrast to the lack of an impact of commensal microbiota on ILC2s in other tissues. The microbiota dependency of stomach ILC2s is partly explained by their responsiveness to interleukin (IL)-7. Stomach ILC2s express significantly higher IL-7 receptor protein levels on their surface and proliferate more in response to IL-7 stimulation in vitro than small intestinal ILC2s. Consistently, the stomach expresses much higher IL-7 protein levels than the small intestine. IL-5 secreted from stomach ILC2s promotes immunoglobulin (Ig) A production by plasma B cells. In a murine model, stomach ILC2s are important in containing Helicobacter pylori infection, especially in the early phase of infection, by promoting IgA production. The stomach’s microbiota, and its effect on immune development, may be key factors in fending off infection with Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium found in the stomach that can lead to gastric upset and, if left untreated, ulcers or stomach cancer. Unlike the intestines, the stomach was thought to contain few bacteria owing to its high acidity, but according to new studies, the stomach harbors its own set of microbiota. Hiroshi Ohno and Naoko Satoh-Takayama at the RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences and Yokohama City University, Japan, review how gastric microbiota affects development of immune cells in the stomach. They report that the stomach’s unique microbiota influences maturation of particular immune cells, which may be crucial in fighting off H. pylori infection. These findings illuminate a new area in microbiome research."
3,"Medical expenses of urban Chinese patients with stomach cancer during 2002–2011: a hospital-based multicenter retrospective study In China, stomach cancer is the third most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death. Few studies have examined Chinese stomach cancer patients’ medical expenses and their associated trends. The Cancer Screening Program in Urban China (CanSPUC) is a Major Public Health Project funded by the central government. Through this project, we have extracted patients’ medical expenses from hospital billing data to examine the costs of the first course treatments (which refers to 2 months before and 10 months after the date of cancer diagnosis) in Chinese patients with stomach cancer and the associated trends. The expense data of 14,692 urban Chinese patients with stomach cancer were collected from 40 hospitals in 13 provinces. We estimated the inflation-adjusted medical expenses per patient during 2002–2011. We described the time trends of medical expenses at the country-level, and those trends by subgroup, and analyzed the compositions of medical expenses. We constructed the Generalized Linear Mixed (GLM) regression model with Poisson distribution to examine the factors that were associated with medical expenses per patient. The average medical expenses of the first course treatments were about 43,249 CNY (6851 USD) in 2011, more than twice of that in 2002. The expenses increased by an average annual rate of 7.4%. Longer stay during hospitalization and an increased number of episodes of care are the two main contributors to the expense increase. The upward trend of medical expenses was observed in almost all patient subgroups. Drug expenses accounted for over half of the medical expenses. The average medical expenses of the first course (2 months before and 10 months after the date of cancer diagnosis) treatments per stomach cancer patient in urban China in 2011 were doubled during the previous 10 years, and about twice as high as the per capita disposable income of urban households in the same year. Such high expenses indicate that it makes economic sense to invest in cancer prevention and control in China."
3,"Identification of valid reference genes for gene expression studies of human stomach cancer by reverse transcription-qPCR Reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a powerful method for the analysis of gene expression. Target gene expression levels are usually normalized to a consistently expressed reference gene also known as internal standard, in the same sample. However, much effort has not been expended thus far in the search for reference genes suitable for the study of stomach cancer using RT-qPCR, although selection of optimal reference genes is critical for interpretation of results. We assessed the suitability of six possible reference genes, beta-actin (ACTB), glyceraldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase 1 (HPRT1), beta-2-microglobulin (B2M), ribosomal subunit L29 (RPL29) and 18S ribosomal RNA (18S rRNA) in 20 normal and tumor stomach tissue pairs of stomach cancer patients and 6 stomach cancer cell lines, by RT-qPCR. Employing expression stability analyses using NormFinder and geNorm algorithms we determined the order of performance of these reference genes and their variation values. This RT-qPCR study showed that there are statistically significant (p < 0.05) differences in the expression levels of HPRT1 and 18S rRNA in 'normal-' versus 'tumor stomach tissues'. The stability analyses by geNorm suggest B2M-GAPDH, as best reference gene combination for 'stomach cancer cell lines'; RPL29-HPRT1, for 'all stomach tissues'; and ACTB-18S rRNA, for 'all stomach cell lines and tissues'. NormFinder also identified B2M as the best reference gene for 'stomach cancer cell lines', RPL29-B2M for 'all stomach tissues', and 18S rRNA-ACTB for 'all stomach cell lines and tissues'. The comparisons of normalized expression of the target gene, GPNMB, showed different interpretation of target gene expression depend on best single reference gene or combination. This study validated RPL29 and RPL29-B2M as the best single reference genes and combination, for RT-qPCR analysis of 'all stomach tissues', and B2M and B2M-GAPDH as the best single reference gene and combination, for 'stomach cancer cell lines'. Use of these validated reference genes should provide more exact interpretation of differential gene expressions at transcription level in stomach cancer."
3,"Comprehensive analysis of inhibin-β A as a potential biomarker for gastrointestinal tract cancers through bioinformatics approaches. Inhibin, β, which is also known as INHBA, encodes a protein that belongs to the Transforming Growth factor-β (TGF-β) superfamily, which plays a pivotal role in cancer. Gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) cancer refers to the cancers that develop in the colon, liver, esophagus, stomach, rectum, pancreas, and bile ducts of the digestive system. The role of INHBA in all GI tract cancers remains understudied. By utilizing GEPIA2, which uses transcriptomic data from TCGA, we examined the expression of INHBA across different GI tract cancers. The results revealed consistent upregulation of INHBA in all TCGA GI tract cancers, except for liver hepatocellular carcinoma, where it showed downregulation compared to normal tissues, along with GTEx normal samples. Significant differences in INHBA expression were noted in adenocarcinomas of the colon, pancreas, rectum, and stomach, while no such differences were observed in cholangiocarcinoma and liver cancer. Moreover, a comprehensive bioinformatics analysis has been done to demonstrate that the differences in expression levels are significantly related to pathological tumor stages and prognosis in different GI tract cancers. Mucinous adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and stomach adenocarcinoma show a higher frequency of INHBA alteration and are primarily linked to mutations and amplifications. DNA methylation, immune infiltration, functional enrichment analysis, the genes associated with INHBA, and survival analysis in all TCGA GI tract cancers have been extensively analyzed. In colon and stomach cancers, increased INHBA expression significantly correlates with poorer overall survival (OS). However, in colon and pancreatic adenocarcinoma, higher expression is significantly associated with worse disease-free survival (DFS). Additionally, INHBA expression exhibited a positive correlation with cancer-associated fibroblasts across all gastrointestinal (GI) tract cancers. The KEGG pathway analysis revealed that INHBA and its interacting proteins are involved in several pathways, including TGF-beta signaling, Signalling pathways regulating pluripotency of stem cells, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, AGE-RAGE signaling, and so on as major pathways. These findings demonstrate that INHBA could serve as a potential biomarker therapeutic target for GI tract cancer."
3,"Splicing-dependent expression of microRNAs of mirtron origin in human digestive and excretory system cancer cells An abundant class of intronic microRNAs (miRNAs) undergoes atypical Drosha-independent biogenesis in which the spliceosome governs the excision of hairpin miRNA precursors, called mirtrons. Although nearly 500 splicing-dependent miRNA candidates have been recently predicted via bioinformatic analysis of human RNA-Seq datasets, only a few of them have been experimentally validated. The detailed mechanism of miRNA processing by the splicing machinery and the roles of mirtronic miRNAs in cancer are yet to be uncovered. We experimentally examined whether biogenesis of certain miRNAs is under a splicing control by analyzing their expression levels in response to alterations in the 5′- and 3′-splice sites of a series of intron-containing minigenes carrying appropriate miRNAs. The expression levels of the miRNAs processed from mirtrons were determined by quantitative real-time PCR in five digestive tract (pancreas PANC-1, SU.86.86, T3M4, stomach KATOIII, colon HCT116) and two excretory system (kidney CaKi-1, 786-O) carcinoma cell lines as well as in pancreatic, stomach, and colorectal tumors. Transiently expressed SRSF1 and SRSF2 splicing factors were quantified by western blotting in the nuclear fractions of HCT116 cells. We found that biogenesis of the human hsa-miR-1227-3p, hsa-miR-1229-3p, and hsa-miR-1236-3p is splicing-dependent; therefore, these miRNAs can be assigned to the class of miRNAs processed by a non-canonical mirtron pathway. The expression analysis revealed a differential regulation of human mirtronic miRNAs in various cancer cell lines and tumors. In particular, hsa-miR-1229-3p is selectively upregulated in the pancreatic and stomach cancer cell lines derived from metastatic sites. Compared with the healthy controls, the expression of hsa-miR-1226-3p was significantly higher in stomach tumors but extensively downregulated in colorectal tumors. Furthermore, we provided evidence that overexpression of SRSF1 or SRSF2 can upregulate the processing of individual mirtronic miRNAs in HCT116 cells. An interplay of different splicing factors, such as SRSF1 or SRSF2, may alter the levels of miRNAs of mirtron origin in a cell. Our findings underline the specific expression profiles of mirtronic miRNAs in colorectal, stomach, and pancreatic cancer."
3,"Relationships between cancer pattern, country income and geographical region in Asia Background: Cancer incidence and mortality varies across region, sex and country’s economic status. While most studies focused on global trends, this study aimed to describe and analyse cancer incidence and mortality in Asia, focusing on cancer site, sex, region and income status. Methods: Age-standardised incidence and mortality rates of cancer were extracted from the GLOBOCAN 2012 database. Cancer mortality to incidence ratios (MIRs) were calculated to represent cancer survival. The data were analysed based on the four regions in Asia and income. Results: Cancer incidence rate is lower in Asia compared to the West but for MIR, it is the reverse. In Asia, the most common cancers in men are lung, stomach, liver, colorectal and oesophageal cancers while the most common cancers in women are breast, lung, cervical, colorectal and stomach cancers. The MIRs are the highest in lung, liver and stomach cancers and the lowest in colorectal, breast and prostate cancers. Eastern and Western Asia have a higher incidence of cancer compared to South-Eastern and South-Central Asia but this pattern is the reverse for MIR. Cancer incidence rate increases with country income particularly in colorectal and breast cancers but the pattern is the opposite for MIR. Conclusion: This study confirms that there is a wide variation in cancer incidence and mortality across Asia. This study is the first step towards documenting and explaining the changing cancer pattern in Asia in comparison to the rest of the world. Background Recent studies have found that developing countries, particularly those in Asia, are facing a rising cancer incidence. The incidence rates of cancers such as lung and colorectal in some Asian countries have surpassed that of Western countries [1, 2]. This change may be due to the adoption of cancer-related lifestyle such as smoking, alcohol consumption, physical inactivity, obesity and high-fat, low-fibre diet [3]; environmental and occupational risk factors such as air pollution, indoor smoke from household use of solid fuel; and contaminated"
3,"Rare case of gastric inflammatory fibroid polyp located at the fornix of the stomach and mimicking gastric cancer: a case report. Gastric inflammatory fibroid polyp (IFP) is a rare polypoid lesion of the stomach that is characterized pathologically by the presence of spindle cells, a prominent network of blood vessels, and inflammatory infiltration of eosinophils. IFP is mainly located in the gastric antrum and is usually semi-pedunculated and covered with normal mucosa. There have been several reports of large IFPs with ulceration on the surface, at the apex, but no report of the IFP with ulceration at the fornix of the stomach. We report a case of IFP with ulceration that was suggested to be gastric cancer and was resected for diagnostic treatment. A 79-year-old woman presented to our hospital. During mass screening for cancer, stomach fluoroscopy revealed an abnormal shadow. Endoscopy showed an ulcerated tumor at the fornix of stomach; hence, gastric cancer was suggested because of the polypoid lesion with irregular ridges and ulceration. Pathological diagnosis of gastric biopsy specimens revealed an inflammation of the gastric mucosa, and specific findings for gastric cancer were not obtained. Because we could not exclude gastric malignancies such as cancer or gastrointestinal stromal tumor, we performed a partial resection of the stomach with a 2-cm margin using the laparoscopic-assisted method. Pathological examination of the resected specimen revealed that the tumor was present in the submucosal layer and consisted of collagen fiber containing inflammatory cell infiltration of mainly eosinophils. A prominent network of blood vessels was also found in the specimens. Immunohistochemical staining revealed mild positivity for CD34, and α-SMA and was negative for c-kit, DOG-1, s-100, desmin, ALK, and IgG4. The lesion was thus diagnosed as an IFP. The postoperative course was uneventful. The patient is currently asymptomatic and has shown no recurrence. IFPs have variable locational, morphological, histological, pathological, and immunohistochemical features. We reported that the gastric IFP was located at the fornix of the stomach and was similar in morphology to gastric cancer. This case is clinically significant to avoid over-surgery."

3,"Joint disease mapping using six cancers in the Yorkshire region of England. The aims of this study were to model jointly the incidence rates of six smoking related cancers in the Yorkshire region of England, to explore the patterns of spatial correlation amongst them, and to estimate the relative weight of smoking and other shared risk factors for the relevant disease sites, both before and after adjustment for socioeconomic background (SEB). Data on the incidence of oesophagus, stomach, pancreas, lung, kidney, and bladder cancers between 1983 and 2003 were extracted from the Northern & Yorkshire Cancer Registry database for the 532 electoral wards in the Yorkshire region. Using postcode of residence, each case was assigned an area-based measure of SEB using the Townsend index. Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated for each cancer site and their correlations investigated. The joint analysis of the spatial variation in incidence used a Bayesian shared-component model. Three components were included to represent differences in smoking (for all six sites), bodyweight/obesity (for oesophagus, pancreas and kidney cancers) and diet/alcohol consumption (for oesophagus and stomach cancers). The incidence of cancers of the oesophagus, pancreas, kidney, and bladder was relatively evenly distributed across the region. The incidence of stomach and lung cancers was more clustered around the urban areas in the south of the region, and these two cancers were significantly associated with higher levels of area deprivation. The incidence of lung cancer was most impacted by adjustment for SEB, with the rural/urban split becoming less apparent. The component representing smoking had a larger effect on cancer incidence in the eastern part of the region. The effects of the other two components were small and disappeared after adjustment for SEB. This study demonstrates the feasibility of joint disease modelling using data from six cancer sites. Incidence estimates are more precise than those obtained without smoothing. This methodology may be an important tool to help authorities evaluate healthcare system performance and the impact of policies."
3,"Time trends in municipal distribution patterns of cancer mortality in Spain New disease mapping techniques widely used in small-area studies enable disease distribution patterns to be identified and have become extremely popular in the field of public health. This paper reports on trends in the geographical mortality patterns of the most frequent cancers in Spain, over a period of 20 years. We studied the municipal spatial pattern of stomach, colorectal, lung, breast, prostate and urinary bladder cancer mortality in Spain across four quinquennia, spanning the period 1989-2008. Case data were broken down by town (8073 municipalities), period and sex. Expected cases for each town were calculated using reference rates for each five-year period. For map plotting purposes, smoothed municipal relative risks were calculated using the conditional autoregressive model proposed by Besag, York and Mollie, with independent data for each quinquennium. We evaluated the presence of spatial patterns in maps on the basis of models, calculating the variance in relative risk corresponding to the structured spatial component and the unstructured component, as well as the proportion of variance explained by the structured spatial component. The mortality patterns observed for stomach, colorectal and lung cancer were maintained over the 20 years covered by the study. Prostate cancer and the tumours studied in women showed no defined spatial pattern, with the single exception of stomach cancer. The trend in spatial fractional variance indicated the possibility of a change in the spatial pattern in breast, bladder and colorectal cancer in women during the last five-year period. The paper goes on to discuss ways in which spatio-temporal data are depicted in the case of cancer, and review the risk factors that may possibly influence the respective tumours’ spatial patterns. In men, the marked geographical patterns of stomach, colorectal, lung and bladder cancer remained stable over time. Breast, colorectal and bladder cancer in women show signs of the possible appearance of a spatial pattern in Spain and should therefore be monitored."
3,"Nutrition deficiency increases the risk of stomach cancer mortality The purpose of the study is to determine whether exposure to malnutrition during early life is associated with increased risk of stomach cancer in later life. The design protocol included analyzing the trend of gastric cancer mortality and nutrition and evaluating the association between nutrient deficiency in early life and the risk of gastric cancer by hierarchical age–period–birth cohort (APC) analysis using general log-linear Poisson models and to compare the difference between birth cohorts who were exposed to the 1959–1961 Chinese famine and those who were not exposed to the famine. Data on stomach cancer mortality from 1970 to 2009 and the dietary patterns from 1955 to 1985 which included the 1959–1961 Chinese famine period in the Zhaoyuan County population were obtained. The nutrition information was collected 15 years prior to the mortality data as based on the latest reference of disease incubation. APC analysis revealed that severe nutrition deficiency during early life may increase the risk of stomach cancer. Compared with the 1960–1964 birth cohort, the risk for stomach cancer in all birth cohorts from 1900 to 1959 significantly increased; compared with the 1970–1974 cohort, the risk for stomach cancer in the 1975–1979 cohort significantly increased, whereas the others had a steadily decreased risk; compared with 85–89 age group in the 2005–2009 death survey, the ORs decreased with younger age and reached significant levels for the 50–54 age group after adjusting the confounding factors. The 1930 to 1964 group (exposed to famine) had a higher mortality rate than the 1965 to 1999 group (not exposed to famine). For males, the relative risk (RR) was 2.39 and the 95% confidence interval (CI) was 1.51 to 3.77. For females, RR was 1.64 and 95% CI was 1.02 to 2.62. The results of the present study suggested that prolonged malnutrition during early life may increase the risk of stomach cancer mortality in later life."
3,"A cross-national perspective of migration and cancer: incidence of five major cancer types among resettlers from the former Soviet Union in Germany and ethnic Germans in Russia Few studies compared cancer incidence among migrants both to their host countries and to their population of origin. We aimed to compare cancer incidence of ethnic Germans who migrated from the former Soviet Union to Germany (resettlers) to those living in Russia as well as to the German and the Russian general populations. The cancer registry of North Rhine-Westphalia identified incident cases of stomach, colorectal, lung, breast and prostate cancer in resettlers and the general population of the administrative district of Munster (Germany) between 2004 and 2013. The Tomsk cancer registry collected the same data in ethnic Germans and the general population of the Tomsk region (Russia). We used standardised incidence rate ratios (SIRs) to compare rates of resettlers and ethnic Germans with the respective general populations. The total number of person-years under risk was 83,289 for ethnic Germans, 8,006,775 for the population of Tomsk, 219,604 for resettlers, and 20,516,782 for the population of Munster. Incidence of the five investigated cancer types among ethnic Germans did not differ from incidence of the general population of Tomsk. Compared to the general population of Tomsk, incidence among resettlers was higher for colorectal cancer in both sexes (females: SIR 1.45 [95% CI 1.14–1.83], males: SIR 1.56 [95% CI 1.23–1.97]), breast cancer in females (SIR 1.65 [95% CI 1.40–1.95]), and prostate cancer (SIR 1.64 [95% CI 1.34–2.01]). Incidence rates of these cancer types among resettlers were more similar to rates of the general population of Munster. Incidence of stomach and lung cancer did not differ between resettlers and the general population of Tomsk. After an average stay of 15 years, we observed that incidence of colorectal, breast and prostate cancer among resettlers converged to levels of the general population of Munster. Resettler’s incidence of stomach and lung cancer, however, was comparable to incidence in their population of origin. Causes must be investigated in subsequent analytical studies."
3,"Cancer variation associated with the position of the mutation in the BRCA2 gene. Inherited mutations of the BRCA2 gene give rise to a multi-site cancer phenotype which includes breast cancer (in female and males), ovarian, pancreatic and prostate cancer, ocular and other melanomas, laryngeal, colon and stomach cancers. Interpretation of test results and risk assessment is therefore complex. It has been proposed that families with mutations in the ovarian cancer cluster region (OCCR) of exon 11 (nucleotides 3035-6629) express a higher ratio of ovarian to breast cancer, than families with mutations elsewhere in the BRCA2 gene. In this study we have investigated the presence of 7 types of cancer (ovary, male breast, pancreas, prostate, colon, stomach and melanoma) in first- and second-degree relatives of mutation-positive individuals in 440 families with a BRCA2 mutation. We reviewed histories of cancer in relatives among families with mutations distributed throughout the gene. Families with ovarian cancer were more likely to harbour mutations in the OCCR (nucleotides 3035-6629) than elsewhere in the gene (OR = 2.21; P = 0.0002). We also compared cancer risks according to ethnic group. Ashkenazi Jewish families with the 6174delT founder mutation were more likely to have a family member with ovarian cancer (OR = 1.58; P = 0.002) and less likely to have a family member with prostate cancer (OR = 0.62; P = 0.04) than were non-Jewish families. In contrast, a reduced presence of ovarian cancer was found in families of French-Canadian ancestry, compared to other ancestries (OR = 0.37; P = 0.0026). A high risk of male breast cancer was observed with the 6503delTT mutation (OR = 15.7; P = 0.023). Families of Polish ancestry had a reduced frequency of pancreatic cancer (OR = 0.0; P = 0.03) compared to families of other ethnic origins. In conclusion, both the position of mutation and the ethnic background of the family appear to contribute to the phenotypic variation observed in families with BRCA2 mutations."

3,"Incidence and survival of oesophageal and gastric cancer in England between 1998 and 2007, a population-based study Background: Major changes in the incidence of oesophageal and gastric cancers have been reported internationally. This study describes recent trends in incidence and survival of subgroups of oesophageal and gastric cancer in England between 1998 and 2007 and considers the implications for cancer services and policy. Methods: Data on 133,804 English patients diagnosed with oesophageal and gastric cancer between 1998 and 2007 were extracted from the National Cancer Data Repository. Using information on anatomical site and tumour morphology, data were divided into six groups; upper and middle oesophagus, lower oesophagus, oesophagus with an unspecified anatomical site, cardia, non-cardia stomach, and stomach with an unspecified anatomical site. Age-standardised incidence rates (per 100,000 European standard population) were calculated for each group by year of diagnosis and by socioeconomic deprivation. Survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: The majority of oesophageal cancers were in the lower third of the oesophagus (58%). Stomach with an unspecified anatomical site was the largest gastric cancer group (53%). The incidence of lower oesophageal cancer increased between 1998 and 2002 and remained stable thereafter. The incidence of cancer of the cardia, noncardia stomach, and stomach with an unspecified anatomical site declined over the 10 year period. Both lower oesophageal and cardia cancers had a much higher incidence in males compared with females (M:F 4:1). The incidence was also higher in the most deprived quintiles for all six cancer groups. Survival was poor in all subgroups with 1 year survival ranging from 14.8-40.8% and 5 year survival ranging from 3.7-15.6%. Conclusions: An increased focus on prevention and early diagnosis, especially in deprived areas and in males, is required to improve outcomes for these cancers. Improved recording of tumour site, stage and morphology and the evaluation of focused early diagnosis programmes are also needed. The poor long-term survival reinforces the need for early detection and multidisciplinary care."
3,"Surgical techniques, open versus minimally invasive gastrectomy after chemotherapy (STOMACH trial): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial Laparoscopic surgery has been shown to provide important advantages in comparison with open procedures in the treatment of several malignant diseases, such as less perioperative blood loss and faster patient recovery. It also maintains similar results with regard to tumor resection margins and oncological long-term survival. In gastric cancer the role of laparoscopic surgery remains unclear. Current recommended treatment for gastric cancer consists of radical resection of the stomach, with a free margin of 5 to 6 cm from the tumor, combined with a lymphadenectomy. The extent of the lymphadenectomy is considered a marker for radicality of surgery and quality of care. Therefore, it is imperative that a novel surgical technique, such as minimally invasive total gastrectomy, should be non-inferior with regard to radicality of surgery and lymph node yield. The Surgical Techniques, Open versus Minimally invasive gastrectomy After CHemotherapy (STOMACH) study is a randomized, clinical multicenter trial. All adult patients with primary carcinoma of the stomach, in which the tumor is considered surgically resectable (T1-3, N0-1, M0) after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, are eligible for inclusion and randomization. The primary endpoint is quality of oncological resection, measured by radicality of surgery and number of retrieved lymph nodes. The pathologist is blinded towards patient allocation. Secondary outcomes include patient-reported outcomes measures (PROMs) regarding quality of life, postoperative complications and cost-effectiveness. Based on a non-inferiority model for lymph node yield, with an average lymph node yield of 20, a non-inferiority margin of −4 and a 90% power to detect non-inferiority, a total of 168 patients are to be included. The STOMACH trial is a prospective, multicenter, parallel randomized study to define the optimal surgical strategy in patients with proximal or central gastric cancer after neo-adjuvant therapy: the conventional ‘open’ approach or minimally invasive total gastrectomy. This trial was registered on 28 April 2014 at Clinicaltrials.gov with the identifier NCT02130726;  ."
3,"Incidence of suicide among adolescent and young adult cancer patients: a population-based study. Background As the survival rates of cancer patients continue to increase, most cancer patients now die of non-cancer causes. Several studies have been showing elevated suicide rates among patients with cancer. However, no large-scale study has thoroughly assessed the risk of suicide among adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer. This study was conducted to characterize suicide mortality among AYA patients in the US and identify risk factors associated with a higher risk of suicide. Methods Patients aged 15-39 years were residents of the US served by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, who were diagnosed with cancers from 1973 to 2015. Results We report that 981 of the 572,500 AYA patients with cancer committed suicide, for an age-, sex-, and race-adjusted suicide rate of 17.68/100,000 person-years. The rate of suicide was 14.33/100,000 person-years in the corresponding general population, giving a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 1.234 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.159-1.313]. Higher suicide rates were associated with male sex, white race, unmarried state, distant tumor stage, and single primary tumor. AYA patients with otorhinolaryngologic, gonad, stomach, soft tissue, and nasopharyngeal cancer were at the greatest risk of suicide compared with those with other types of cancer. In older patients (≥ 40 years), the risk was highest in those with lung, stomach, oral cavity and pharynx, larynx, and bone malignancies. SMRs were highest in the first 5 years after diagnosis for most types of cancer. Conclusion AYA patients with cancer in the US have over 20% higher the incidence of suicide of the general population, and most suicides occurred in the first 5 years following diagnosis. Suicide rates vary among patients with cancers of different anatomic sites. Further examination of the psychological experience of these young patients with cancer, particularly that of those with certain types of cancer, is warranted."
3,"Trends and outcomes of robotic surgery for gastrointestinal (GI) cancers in the USA: maintaining perioperative and oncologic safety. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) continues to gain traction as a feasible approach for the operative management of gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. The aim of this study is to quantify national trends, perioperative and oncologic outcomes of MIS for the most common GI malignancies including the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, colon, and rectum. We hypothesize that with more widespread use of MIS techniques, perioperative outcomes and oncologic resection quality will remain preserved. The National Cancer Database (2010–2014) was utilized to assess perioperative outcomes and pathologic quality of MIS (robotic and laparoscopic) compared to open, in patients who underwent resection for cancers of the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, colon, and rectum. Multilevel logistic regression models were constructed to identify independent factors associated with postoperative and long-term outcomes. Data from 11,023 esophageal, 30,664 gastric, 30,689 pancreas, 260,669 colon, and 52,239 rectal resections were analyzed. Although laparoscopy is the most prevalent MIS approach, the number of robotic resections increased nearly fourfold from 2010 to 2014 in all organ sites (increase by factor: esophagus: 3.8, stomach: 4.4, pancreas: 4.4, colon: 3.8 and rectum: 4). The number of laparoscopic resections increased at a slower rate (factor: 1.3–1.9), whereas the number of open resections decreased (factor: 0.67–0.77). Patients who underwent robotic-assisted resections were younger for stomach and colorectal resections and with lower Charlson Comorbidity Index across all sites. Patients who underwent robotic or laparoscopic resections had shorter hospitalizations, fewer readmissions (with the exception of rectal resections) and lower postoperative mortality at 90 days. Robotic-assisted resections had comparable negative margin resections and number of lymph nodes to laparoscopic and open resections across all sites. The utilization of robotic-assisted resections of GI cancers is rapidly increasing with more frequent use in younger and healthier patients. This study demonstrates that with the rising utilization of robotic-assisted resections, perioperative outcomes and oncologic safety have not been compromised."
3,"Exposure to radon progeny and cancer mortality, excluding lung cancer, in the cohort of Newfoundland Fluorspar Miners between 1950 and 2016. The increased risk of lung cancer from radon progeny among Newfoundland fluorspar miners is well established. In the present study, an internal cohort analysis was conducted to investigate whether radon progeny is also associated with increased mortality from other cancers. Consequently, associations between cumulative radon progeny and cancer mortality (excluding lung cancer) were evaluated in a cohort of 2,110 miners. Mortality was ascertained from 1950 to 2016. Individual-level exposure to radon progeny in working level months (WLM) was determined for each miner during their employment. For cancers with at least ten deaths, Poisson regression was used to estimate excess relative risks (ERRs). Cancer site-specific relative risks were derived for mortality from common cancers within the cohort, specifically: colorectal, prostate, stomach and all cancers (excluding lung cancer). Relative risks were adjusted for age, calendar period, and the number of cigarettes smoked daily determined from smoking surveys. In total, 260 cancer deaths, excluding lung cancer, were identified during follow-up. The relative risk of death from these cancers was 1.26 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.92, 1.75) among underground miners with a cumulative exposure of ≥ 50 WLM when compared to those with < 1 WLM. The ERR per 100 WLM for cancer mortality (excluding lung cancer) was 0.02 (95% CI=-0.01 to 0.05). No statistically significant increased risks with increasing exposure were found for bladder, colorectal, pancreatic, and stomach cancer. Overall, these findings provide modest evidence that radon progeny contributes to increased risks of cancer mortality (excluding lung cancer) among fluorspar miners. However, the precision of the estimates is limited by the small size of the cohort, which restricts the ability to draw firm conclusions regarding specific cancer sites. Future research should consider pooling data from radon-exposed occupational cohorts to better understand the association between radon exposure and the risk of cancers other than lung cancer."
3,"Proximal gastrectomy with exclusion of no. 3b lesser curvature lymph node dissection could be indicated for patients with advanced upper-third gastric cancer. Proximal gastrectomy has been introduced for early gastric cancer located in the upper third of the stomach, but expansion of its indication to advanced tumors has not been generally accepted in terms of lesser curvature lymph node dissection. We reviewed the medical records of 385 patients with tumors in the upper third of the stomach, and the incidence of metastasis and the therapeutic index related to the proximal (no. 3a) and distal (no. 3b) lymph nodes of the lesser curvature were analyzed and compared with those of tumors in the middle third (n = 1093) and lower third (n = 922) of the stomach. The no. 3a rate of metastasis from advanced tumors in the upper third of the stomach was significantly higher than that from tumors in the middle third or lower third of the stomach. The no. 3b metastasis rate did not show any significant differences between the three locations, but the therapeutic index of no. 3b lymph nodes in the upper third of the stomach (1.7) was far lower than that in the middle third (7.1) or lower third (7.0). Further, the rate of metastasis from tumors with the distal border ending in the upper third of the stomach (2.2 %) was significantly (P < 0.0001) lower than that from tumors located in the upper third of the stomach but extending to the middle third (19.6 %), as well as from tumors located in middle third (17.1 %) or lower third (19.6 %), with the therapeutic index being only 1.1. The four no.-3b-positive tumors all measured more than 40 mm, and included one T3 tumor and three T4 tumors. Proximal gastrectomy with exclusion of no. 3b lymphadenectomy could be indicated for at least T2 tumors measuring less than 40 mm localized in the upper third of the stomach."
3,"Bayesian spatio-temporal analysis of stomach cancer incidence in Iran, 2003–2010 Stomach cancer is the second most common cancer in Iranian men and the fourth most common cancer in Iranian women. The incidence rate of this cancer in Iranian men is almost 2.5 times that in women. The objective of this study was to investigate the trend of stomach cancer incidence rate in Iran in an 8-year time period (2003–2010) and also update the incidence estimates of stomach cancer. Data from a total number of 41,830 patients diagnosed with stomach cancer according to the International Classification of Diseases (C16) in 2003–2010 were analyzed. We used Bayesian spatial and Bayesian spatio-temporal models to study the relative risk and trend of stomach cancer incidence rate in Iran. Out of 41,830 stomach cancer registered patients, 72% were male. The average smoothed SIRs were 0.79, 0.82 and 0.78 for the general, female and male population, respectively. This shows a nearly stable incidence rate. The northwest of Iran had the highest incidence rate of stomach cancer. The trend of this rate was declining to the lowest rate in the southeast of the country. The estimated values of coefficient of the trend term for general, female and male population in this model were 0.0085, − 0.018 and 0.0041, which indicate almost a stable fixed trend. The map of temporal trends also showed that although the incidence rate of this cancer is to some extent stable, in general, in the central and in the east of the country the incidence relative risk has increased over time. The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection, Lower socioeconomic status and Iodine deficiency were speculated to be relevant factors for the high incidence rates of stomach cancer in the northwest of Iran. Preventive measures in the north and northwest of Iran could have an effect on controlling this cancer in these areas."

Cancer incidence in the Dalgety Bay area of Fife, Scotland, was examined following the detection of radium-226 particles by routine radiation monitoring. The study was confounded by rapid population growth, demographic change and the relatively high socioeconomic status of the Dalgety Bay population. Health Board Primary Care Division records were used to calculate population estimates and Carstairs deprivation score was used to adjust for socioeconomic characteristics. In the period 1975-90, 211 residents were registered as having cancer compared with 214.21 expected from Scottish national rates. Of specific cancers possibly associated with radiation, the incidence of stomach, liver, lung, bone, prostate, bladder and kidney cancer and lymphoma were lower than expected while colon, rectum, pancreas, skin, breast and thyroid cancer and multiple myeloma and leukaemia were higher. There were three cases of childhood leukaemia compared with 1.22 expected. The only statistically significant differences observed were for pancreas (11 cases, O/E 2.28), lung (25 cases, O/E 0.65) and non-melanoma skin (36 cases, O/E 1.50). Stomach cancer was of borderline statistical significance (four cases, O/E 0.40). Adjustments for socioeconomic factors accounted for the apparently low incidence of stomach and lung cancer and, to a lesser extent, skin cancer, which remained of borderline statistical significance. Results in relation to pancreas cancer were unchanged. The observations of raised incidence of pancreas and skin cancer arose in the context of a survey of 17 cancer sites, from which the finding of two or more statistically significant results is not unusual (P = 0.21), and the numbers of cases involved were small. The epidemiological evidence for an association between radiation exposure and pancreas cancer risk is weak. Stronger evidence exists for an association with skin cancer. In the present study the anatomical distribution of the 36 cases was similar to that found elsewhere in Scotland."
3,"Significance of (18)F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose accumulation in the stomach on positron emission tomography. To explain the accumulation of 18F-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-glucose (18FDG) on positron emission tomography (PET) in the stomach and differences in its pattern, we focus on the accumulation pattern in association with endoscopic findings of the gastric mucosa and Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection. Of 599 cases undergoing 18FDG-PET examinations, we retrospectively analyzed the pattern of 18FDG accumulation in the stomach, findings of upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, and Hp infection. The pattern of 18FDG accumulation was classified into three groups: localized accumulation only in the fornix (Group A, 32 patients), diffuse accumulation throughout the entire stomach (Group B, 49 patients), and no accumulation (Group C, 191 patients). Regarding the relation between Hp infection and 18FDG accumulation, Hp infection was positive in 56.3% of Group A, 73.5% of Group B, and 24.1% of Group C, with significant differences (p < 0.001). Regarding the relation between 18FDG accumulation and gastric mucosal inflammation, when Groups A and B were compared with Group C, nearly half of the cases in the former groups had papular redness with a significantly higher frequency of redness and erosion. Three cases found to have malignant tumor were limited to the former groups. One MALT lymphoma case was also found in the same group. Accumulation of 18FDG largely corresponded to mucosal inflammation including superficial gastritis and erosive gastritis, and therefore the main cause of non-specific 18FDG accumulation was considered to be inflammatory mucosa (mainly redness). The accumulation pattern was not associated with atrophic changes of the gastric mucosa or with Hp infection, but with mucosal inflammatory changes, including redness and erosion localized to the fornix. Accumulation of 18FDG in the stomach suggests a high probability of the presence of inflammatory change in the gastric mucosa forming a background for the development of cancer or malignant lymphoma, and thus requires further endoscopic examinations."
3,"The demographic characteristics of histological types of gastric cancer with gender, age, and tumor location. The objective of this paper is to study demographic characteristics of different histological types with patient's gender, age, and tumor location in gastric cancer. Three hundred and fifty-one patients who had gastric cancer and undergone a D2 or greater gastrectomy were analyzed retrospectively. The association between gender and age, tumor location and histological types, including tubular adenocarcinoma (TUB), poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (POR), signet-ring cell carcinoma (SIG), mucinous adenocarcinoma, and undifferentiated carcinoma (UND), were analyzed by chi-square test or Fisher exact test. The proportion of TUB in males was higher than that in females (52.4% vs 30.1%, p value of 0.000), and the proportion of SIG in females was higher than that in males (26.2% vs 12.9%, p = 0.002). The prevalence of TUB in patients aged >60 years (54.9%) was significantly higher than that in patients aged 40–60 years (42.2%) and <40 years (24.1%). The prevalence of SIG in the group aged <40 years was significantly higher than that in the other two age groups (44.8% vs 15.6%, 12.7%, p = 0.000). Among the three age groups, the proportion of UND was highest in patients aged 40–60 years (7.8% vs 0%, 1.4%, p = 0.012). The proportion of TUB was highest in the upper part of the stomach as compared to the middle and lower parts of the stomach (56.1% vs 30.8%, 48.2%, p = 0.016). POR was commonly found in the middle part of the stomach as compared to the upper and lower parts (44.6% vs 26.1%, 14.6%, p = 0.002). TUB was commonly found in the upper part of the stomach in old, male patients, and SIG was the most common histological type in young, female patients. UND was common in middle-aged patients, and POR was mainly found in the middle part of the stomach."
3,"Monitoring circulating tumor DNA by analyzing personalized cancer-specific rearrangements to detect recurrence in gastric cancer. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a candidate biomarker for cancer screening. However, studies on the usefulness of ctDNA for postoperative recurrence monitoring are limited. The present study monitored ctDNA in postoperative blood by employing cancer-specific rearrangements. Personalized cancer-specific rearrangements in 25 gastric cancers were analyzed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and were employed for ctDNA monitoring with blood up to 12 months after surgery. Personalized cancer-specific rearrangements were identified in 19 samples. The median lead time, which is the median duration between a positive ctDNA detection and recurrence, was 4.05 months. The presence of postoperative ctDNA prior to clinical recurrence was significantly correlated with cancer recurrence within 12 months of surgery (P = 0.029); in contrast, no correlation was found between cancer recurrence and the presence of preoperative ctDNA, suggesting the clinical usefulness of postoperative ctDNA monitoring for cancer recurrence in gastric cancer patients. However, the clinical application of ctDNA can be limited by the presence of ctDNA non-shedders (42.1%, 8/19) and by inconsistent postoperative ctDNA positivity. Fragments of tumor DNA, or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), in blood can help predict stomach cancer recurrence within 12 months of surgery. Kyeong-Man Hong at the National Cancer Center, in Goyang-si, South Korea, and colleagues, carried out whole genome sequencing of stomach tumor samples from 25 patients to identify personalized cancer-specific rearranged DNA sequences. When they used this information to monitor ctDNA in blood samples obtained after surgical removal of the tumor, they found a significant correlation between the presence of ctDNA and cancer recurrence. In most cases, ctDNA was detected around four months prior to clinical recurrence, highlighting the potential usefulness of ctDNA monitoring. The lack of correlation between ctDNA levels and tumor size suggests that further research into the factors determining ctDNA levels is needed."
3,"Gastric cancer progression associated with local humoral immune responses Although the association between H. pylori and gastric cancer has been well described, the alterations studies are scarce in the humoral immune response in specific anatomical areas of stomach and during the stages of gastric cancer. The aim in this study was to determine the influence of humoral immune responses against H. pylori infection on gastric carcinoma. We selected 16 gastric cancer cases and approximately one matched control per case at the National Institute of Medical Sciences and Nutrition Salvador Zubiran (INCMNSZ); all the cases met the inclusion criteria for the study. We obtained three biopsies from each patient and from each of the predetermined regions of the stomach: antrum, angular portion, corpus, and fundus. From the patients with gastric cancer, additional biopsy specimens were obtained from tumor mid-lesion and tumor margin, and additional specimens were collected at least 2 and 5 cm from the tumor margin. We compared IgA levels against H. pylori in each area of stomach between cases and controls as well as between early and advanced stages of gastric cancer. IgA values were strikingly elevated in cancer cases compared with control subjects; a value that was even higher in the distant periphery of tumor but was remarkably decreased toward the carcinoma lesion. The advanced stages of gastric cancer demonstrated the relapse of the humoral immune response in the mid-lesion region of the tumor compared with the tumor margins and adjacent non-tumor tissue. Gastric cancer is characterized by progressive accumulation of a concentrated, specific IgA response against H. pylori, beginning with an abnormal increase in the entire stomach but particularly in the adjacent non-tumor tissue. Thus, it is possible that this strong immune response also participates in some degree in the damage and in the development of gastric cancer to some extent."

3,"Epidemiological research in stomach cancer: progress over the last ten years. In this paper the progress of epidemiological research in stomach cancer during 1980–1990 is reviewed in respect to regional variation, etiology, and formation of carcinogens. The evaluation of 4 cohort and 16 case-control studies revealed a consistently inverse relationship of stomach cancer risk with raw vegetables, fruit, and wholemeal bread consumption and with vitamin C and carotene intake. Milk, cooked vegetables and vitamins A and E were not consistently found to be related to stomach cancer risk. Positive associations of increasing consumption with stomach cancer risk were occasionally found for processed or particularly prepared meat and fish, and for nitrite. Dietary nitrate intake did not appear to be related to stomach cancer risk in these studies. This latter observation is also supported by metabolic studies in high- and low-risk areas for stomach cancer. Consistently among studies, increased risk for stomach cancer was also found for later availability of refrigeration facilities in the household, non-centralized water supply (especially well water), and high salt intake. Prospective studies agreed in an increased risk for stomach cancer for cigarette smoking, but not for alcohol drinking, whereas case-control studies showed divergent results on these factors. Recent metabolic studies in high- and low-risk areas for stomach cancer or in groups with precursor lesions, with theN-nitrosoproline test as a marker for endogenous nitrosation, revealed inconsistent results. Higher nitrite concentration and increased pH in stomach juice were found to be associated with precursor conditions for stomach cancer. It is still not clear whether intake of preformed carcinogens or endogenous formation in the stomach with or without the inclusion of nitrite is the most important source of tumor-initiating or-promoting substances. Preservation or preparation of meat and fish may play an important role in this process, and vitamin C may be an inhibiting substance."
3,"Several knowledges about treatment of surgical jaundice The purpose of the present investigation is to acquire knowledge about factors influencing operative results of surgical jaundice. The authors analyzed the 259 cases with obstructive jaundice which were operated for the latest eleven years. The items of 259 cases were 78 cases with cancer of bile duct or head of pancreas, 117 cases with gall stone, 34 with inflammatory disease, 7 with congenital obstruction of bile duct and 23 with postoperative relapse of stomach cancer. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1) The cases were classified by grades of jaundice as the cases of slight, moderate and severe jaundice. Among the cases with malignant tumors 62.4o{, showed severe jaundice and only 9.9% slight jaundice, while among the cases of benign diseases without malignant tumor only 8.6o/0 showed severe jaundice and 53.6% slight jaundice. 2) Operative death without one month after operation occured in 53 cases or 20.5%; 39.4% of the cases with cancer of bile duct or pancreas, 30.4~ of the cases with postoperative relapse of stomach cancer, 11 8% of those with inflammatory diseases and 7.7% of those with gall stones. Operative mortality of every operative procedures were 56% in exploratory laparotomy, 47.4% in pancreatoduodenectomy, 38.5% in construction of internal biliary fistulas and 21.2 % in external biliary drainage. 3) In the cases with gall stone, grades of jaundice were very important factors which influence operative mortality, while in thosc with cancer either of bile duct or of relapsing stomach cancer, grades of jaundice had no connection with mortality. 4) The cases of postoperative deaths were general prostration in 12 cases, cardiac failure in 11 eases, hepatic coma in 9 cases, peritonitis in 7 cases, massive bleeding in 6 cases, pulmonary complications in 2 cases and tile other in 6 cases."

3,"Molecular mechanism of stomach carcinogenesis Gene changes in multiple oncogenes, multiple growth factors and multiple tumor-suppressor genes are observed in stomach cancer. Among them, those most commonly implicated in both well-differentiated adenocarcinoma and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma are inactivation (mutations and allele loss) of the p53 gene, and activation (abnormal expression and amplification) of the c-met gene. Moreover, they occur at an early stage of stomach carcinogenesis. In addition, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosome 5q (APC locus) is frequently associated with well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. LOH on chromosome 18q (DCC locus) and LOH of the bcl-2 gene also are common events of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. LOH on chromosomes 1q and 7q may be involved in the progression of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma. Conversely, the development of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, in addition to changes in p53 and c-met genes, requires reduction or dysfunction of cadherin. Overexpression of bcl-2 protein is observed in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma or signet-ring cell carcinoma. Moreover, the K-sam gene is amplified preferentially in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of scirrhous carcinoma. K-sam amplification in scirrhous carcinoma often occurs independently of c-met gene amplification. LOH on chromosome 1p also is relatively common in poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Exceptionally, signet-ring cell carcinoma shares APC mutations. There are some differences in expression of the growth-factor/receptor system between well-differentiated adenocarcinoma and poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Moreover, interaction between cell-adhesion molecules in tumor cells expressing c-met and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) from stromal cells is linked with morphogenesis of two histological types of stomach cancer. Intestinal metaplasia and adenoma of the stomach also contain p53 mutations and K-ras mutations or tpr-met rearrangement. Taken together, different genetic pathways of stomach carcinogenesis may exist for poorly differentiated and well-differentiated stomach cancers. Some of the latter may develop by a cumulative series of gene alterations similar to those of colorectal cancer."
3,"Laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with jejunal interposition for gastric cancer in the proximal third of the stomach: a retrospective comparison with open surgery The incidence of cancer in the proximal third of the stomach is increasing. Laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy (LPG) seems an attractive option for the treatment of early-stage proximal gastric cancer but has not gained wide acceptance because of technical difficulties, including the prevention of severe reflux. In this study, we describe our technique for LPG with jejunal interposition (LPG-IP) and evaluate its safety and feasibility. In this retrospective analysis, we reviewed the data of patients with proximal gastric cancer who underwent LPG-IP (n = 22) or the same procedure with open surgery (OPG-IP; n = 68) between January 2008 and September 2011. Short-term surgical variables and outcomes were compared between the groups. The reconstruction method was the same in both groups, with creation of a 15 cm, single-loop, jejunal interposition for anastomosis. There were no differences in patient or tumor characteristics between the groups. Operation time was longer in the LGP-IP group (233 vs. 201 min, p = 0.0002) and estimated blood loss was significantly less (20 vs. 242 g, p < 0.0001). The average number of harvested lymph nodes did not differ between the two groups (17 vs. 20). There also were no differences in the incidence of leakage at the esophagojejunostomy anastomosis (9.1 vs. 7.4 %) or other postoperative complications (27 vs. 32 %). The number of times additional postoperative analgesia was required was significantly less in the LPG-IP group compared with the OPG-IP group (2 vs. 4, p < 0.0001). LPG-IP has equivalent safety and curability compared with OPG-IP. Our results imply that LPG-IP may lead to faster recovery, better cosmesis, and improved quality of life in the short-term compared with OPG-IP. Because of the limitations of retrospective analysis, a further study should be conducted to obtain definitive conclusions."
3,"Evaluation and clinical significance of the stomach age model for evaluating aging of the stomach-a multicenter study in China A higher prevalence of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) occurs in younger adults in Asia. We used Stomach Age to examine the different mechanisms of CAG between younger adults and elderly individuals, and established a simple model of cancer risk that can be applied to CAG surveillance. Stomach Age was determined by FISH examination of telomere length in stomach biopsies. Δψm was also determined by flow cytometry. Sixty volunteers were used to confirm the linear relationship between telomere length and age while 120 subjects were used to build a mathematical model by a multivariate analysis. Overall, 146 subjects were used to evaluate the validity of the model, and 1,007 subjects were used to evaluate the relationship between prognosis and Δage (calculated from the mathematical model). ROC curves were used to evaluate the relationship between prognosis and Δage and to determine the cut-off point for Δage. We established that a tight linear relationship between the telomere length and the age. The telomere length was obvious different between patients with and without CAG even in the same age. Δψm decreased in individuals whose Stomach Age was greater than real age, especially in younger adults. A mathematical model of Stomach Age (real age + Δage) was successfully constructed which was easy to apply in clinical work. A higher Δage was correlated with a worse outcome. The criterion of Δage >3.11 should be considered as the cut-off to select the subgroup of patients who require endoscopic surveillance. Variation in Stomach Age between individuals of the same biological age was confirmed. Attention should be paid to those with a greater Stomach Age, especially in younger adults. The Δage in the Simple Model can be used as a criterion to select CAG patients for gastric cancer surveillance."

3,"Gastric cancer and diet. A pilot study on dietary habits in two districts differing markedly in respect of mortality from gastric cancer. THE mortality from gastric cancer is still conspicuously high in Ielancd, although some decline has been observed in recent years. Comparing standardized mortality rates for gastric cancer, 1960-61, in 24 countries, of which 16 were in Europe, Segi and Kurihara (1964) found by far the highest rates in Chile and Japan. For males the rates in these countries were 71-0 and 69-5 respectively per 100,000 and next in order came Austria and Finland with rates about 45 per 100,000. In Iceland the similarly standardized mortality rates, 1958-63, were 55-7 for males and 26-7 for females. For males the rate is distinctly higher than in any other country in Western Europe, but for females there is little difference between Iceland, Austria and Finland (Sigurjonsson, 1966a). It was suggested by Dungal (1961) that the unusual frequency and apparently uneven regional distribution of deaths from stomach cancer in Iceland might be related to consumption of smoked food such as meat, trout, salmon etc. Of known carcinogens, 3,4-benzopyrene was found in samples of smoked meat and trout together with other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons such as acenaphthy- lene, phenanthrene, fluorene and anthracene (Bailey and Dungal, 1958). Further, Dungal (1961) was able to produce malignant tumours in rats fed smoked mutton or trout. These tumours were generally of sarcomatous rather than carcinomatous nature and they appeared at various sites. Having these findings in mind a pilot study was planned to compare past dietary habits in two districts differing widely in respect of mortality from stomach cancer. The consumption of smoked food was to be given particular attention. The districts selected were Skagafjar6ars'sla (SKAG), in the northern part * Professor Niels Dungal died in October 1965, before the final draft of this paper had been prepared."

Non-targeted metabolomic analysis showed that the differential metabolites affected 16 signaling pathways including arginine synthesis, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, arginine biosynthesis, and alanine and aspartate and glutamate metabolism between gastric cancer and normal tissue, as well as between tumors located in the middle third of the stomach and other locations. Argininosuccinate synthetase 1 (ASS1), the rate-limiting enzyme of the arginine biosynthesis pathway, catalyzes the production of argininosuccinic acid. Here, knockdown of ASS1 significantly inhibited the proliferation, colony formation, and migration/invasion of gastric cancer cells, and promoted apoptosis.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our study suggests that abnormal arginine synthesis may lead to larger tumor size and worse prognosis in gastric cancer located in the middle third position of the stomach.

In a large international ecological study, comparing urinary sodium excretion and stomach cancer mortality in 39 countries, Joossens et al (1996) concluded that ‘Salt intake, measured as 24-hour urine sodium excretion, is likely the rate-limiting factor of stomach cancer mortality at the population level'. On the basis of human observational and animal experimental data, as well as mechanistic plausibility, the 2003 report from the joint World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization Expert Consultation (WHO/FAO) concluded that salt-preserved food and salt ‘probably' increase the risk of gastric cancer (WHO/FAO, 2003). In fact, there is substantial evidence that the risk of gastric cancer is increased by high intakes of some traditionally preserved salted foods, especially meats and pickles, and with salt per se (Palli, 2000; Tsugane, 2005). The World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) report (2007) concluded that ‘salt is a probable cause of stomach cancer', and that there is robust evidence for the mechanisms operating in humans.; ; In the UK, the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy (COMA) panel on Dietary Reference Values (Department of Health, 1991) advised that sodium (Na) intakes should be maintained below 3.2 g (or 8.0 g of salt) per day and set the reference nutrient intake (RNI) for men and women at 1.6 g of sodium (or 4.0 g of salt) per day. Following this, COMA's Cardiovascular Review Group recommended that salt intake should be gradually reduced further to a daily average of 6 g (Department of Health, 1994). This recommendation was also accepted in the food and health action plan ‘Choosing a better diet' (Department of Health, 2005).; ; In this section, we consider the population-attributable fraction of stomach cancer associated with an intake of salt >6 g per day."
3,"Validity of modified gastrectomy combined with sentinel node navigation surgery for early gastric cancer Background. The present study examined the clinical validity of modifi ed gastrectomy for early gastric cancer, in terms of the results of sentinel node navigation surgery (SNNS), using infrared ray electronic endoscopy (IREE) plus indocyanine green (ICG) staining. Methods. One-hundred and sixty-one patients with fT1N0 gastric cancer were enrolled in the study. ICG (0.5 ml, 5 mg/ ml) was injected endoscopically into four quadrants of the submucosa surrounding the cancer. Twenty minutes after the injection, sentinel lymph nodes (SNs) stained with ICG were observed intraperitoneally around the serosa and surrounding fat tissue. IREE was used to illuminate regional lymph nodes from the serosal side. Results. Group 2 lymph nodes were judged as SNs in 52 patients (32%). The most common locations of the SNs were stations No. 7 in each of the upper-, middle-, and lower-thirds of the stomach. In two patients, lymph node metastasis was positive. One of these patients, with cancer in the middle onethird of the stomach, had SNs in stations No. 3, 4sb, 4d, 7, and No. 11p, and had metastatic lymph nodes in No. 3 and No. 7 (all SNs). The other patient, with cancer in the lower one-third of the stomach, had SNs in No. 1, 3, 4d, and 6, and had a metastatic lymph node in No. 4d (SN). Skip metastasis was not observed in this study, and metastatic lymph nodes were judged to have been dissected by the D1+a procedure. Conclusion. For T1N0 gastric cancer, modifi ed gastrectomy (D1+a dissection) combined with SNNS is suitable; however, for those whose Group 2 lymph nodes are judged to be SNs, additional dissection of lymphatic basins detected by SNNS should be performed to confi rm the absence of lymph node metastasis."
3,"Update of cancer incidence among workers at a copper/nickel smelter and nickel refinery. Objectives: To assess cancer risk among nickel-exposed workers. Methods: We updated cancer incidence among 1388 workers employed for at least 3 months at a copper/nickel smelter and nickel refinery in Harjavalta, Finland. There were 1155 workers exposed to nickel during the period 1960–1985 in the smelter (566 workers), repair shop (239 workers), or refinery (418 workers). Cancer incidence was followed through the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry up to 31 December 1995. For overall cancer and for a priori selected specific cancer types the ratio of observed to expected numbers of cases was computed as a standardized incidence ratio (SIR), controlled for age, gender, and calendar period and using the region-specific rates as a reference. Results: The overall cancer incidence among both nickel-exposed and unexposed subcohorts was at the expected level. A small increase in lung cancer incidence, which reached statistical significance among workers with a latency exceeding 20 years, was observed among the smelter workers exposed to insoluble nickel compounds. Among workers in the refinery, who were exposed primarily to nickel sulfate at levels below 0.5 mg/m3 as well as to low concentrations of other nickel compounds, there was an increased risk for nasal cancer (SIR 41.1, 95% CI 4.97–148), positively associated with latency and duration of employment, and an excess risk for stomach (SIR 4.98, 95% CI 1.62–11.6) and lung (SIR 2.61, 95% CI 0.96–5.67) cancers. Conclusions: Since elevated nasal and lung cancer risks were confined to the refinery, where the primary exposure was to nickel sulfate, it is likely that nickel sulfate is mainly responsible for the elevated respiratory cancer risk. We cannot rule out whether the excess stomach cancer risk is a chance finding, or related to the working environment."
3,"Investigation of gastric cancers in nude mice using X-ray in-line phase contrast imaging. Background: This paper is to report the new imaging of gastric cancers without the use of imaging agents. Both gastric normal regions and gastric cancer regions can be distinguished by using the principal component analysis (PCA) based on the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Methods: Human gastric cancer BGC823 cells were implanted into the stomachs of nude mice. Then, 3, 5, 7, 9 or 11 days after cancer cells implantation, the nude mice were sacrificed and their stomachs were removed. X-ray in-line phase contrast imaging (XILPCI), an X-ray phase contrast imaging method, has greater soft tissue contrast than traditional absorption radiography and generates higher-resolution images. The gastric specimens were imaged by an XILPCIs’ charge coupled device (CCD) of 9 μm image resolution. The PCA of the projective images’ region of interests (ROIs) based on GLCM were extracted to discriminate gastric normal regions and gastric cancer regions. Different stages of gastric cancers were classified by using support vector machines (SVMs). Results: The X-ray in-line phase contrast images of nude mice gastric specimens clearly show the gastric architectures and the details of the early gastric cancers. The phase contrast computed tomography (CT) images of nude mice gastric cancer specimens are better than the traditional absorption CT images without the use of imaging agents. The results of the PCA of the texture parameters based on GLCM of normal regions is (F1 +F 2) > 8.5, but those of cancer regions is (F1 +F 2) < 8.5. The classification accuracy is 83.3% that classifying gastric specimens into different stages using SVMs. Conclusions: This is a very preliminary feasibility study. With further researches, XILPCI could become a noninvasive method for future the early detection of gastric cancers or medical researches."
3,"Characterization and risk estimate of cancer in patients with primary Sjögren syndrome The purpose of this study is to characterize the risk of cancer in a large cohort of patients with primary Sjogren syndrome (SjS). We had analyzed the development of cancer in 1300 consecutive patients fulfilling the 2002 SjS classification criteria. The baseline clinical and immunological characteristics and systemic activity (ESSDAI scores) were assessed at diagnosis as predictors of cancer using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis adjusted for age at diagnosis and gender. The sex-and age-specific standardized incidence ratios (SIR) of cancer were estimated from 2012 Spanish mortality data. After a mean follow-up of 91 months, 127 (9.8%) patients developed 133 cancers. The most frequent type of cancer was B-cell lymphoma (including 27 MALT and 19 non-MALT B-cell lymphomas). Systemic activity at diagnosis of primary SjS correlated with the risk of hematological neoplasia and cryoglobulins with a high risk of either B-cell or non-B-cell lymphoma subtypes. Patients with cytopenias had a high risk of non-MALT B-cell and non-B-cell cancer, while those with low C3 levels had a high risk of MALT lymphomas and those with monoclonal gammopathy and low C4 levels had a high risk of non-MALT lymphomas. The estimated SIR for solid cancer was 1.13 and 11.02 for hematological cancer. SIRs for specific cancers were 36.17 for multiple myeloma and immunoproliferative diseases, 19.41 for Hodgkin lymphoma, 6.04 for other non-Hodgkin lymphomas, 5.17 for thyroid cancer, 4.81 for cancers of the lip and oral cavity, and 2.53 for stomach cancer. One third of cancers developed by patients with primary SjS are B-cell lymphomas. The prognostic factors identified at SjS diagnosis differed according to the subtype of B-cell lymphoma developed. Primary SjS is also associated with the development of some non-hematological cancers (thyroid, oral cavity, and stomach)."
3,"High familial risks in some rare cancers may pinpoint to hidden germline genetics: focus on esophageal, stomach, small intestinal, testis, thyroid and bone cancers. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Germline genetic susceptibilities of rare cancers of the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, testis, (nonmedullary) thyroid gland and bone with high familial risks are not well known. Here, we use familial risk data from the Swedish Family-Cancer Database which contains records of cancers in Swedish families obtained over a century. We compare familial risks for offspring diagnosed with any of these cancers when their parent had or had not that cancer. We review the global literature of the reported constitutional variants that may explain part of the familial risk.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""MAIN BODY"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Familial risks for esophageal and stomach cancers are about 2.0 and apart from early-onset stomach cancer few high-risk variants are known. Genetic studies may be hampered by dominant environmental risk factors for these cancers. Small intestinal carcinoids have a very high familial risk (28 between siblings) but no high-risk genes have been identified to explain this. Low-risk polygenic variants have been identified. Small intestinal adenocarcinoma is a manifestation in Lynch syndrome. Testicular and thyroid cancers are characterized by high familial risk (about 5) which may be explained largely by a polygenic background, although thyroid cancer is a component in a number of rare cancer syndromes. Several predisposing genes have been identified for bone cancer (familial risk 7).</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">The discussed cancers are rare and they present with a relatively high familial risk, in spite of lacking identified high-penetrant constitutional variants. It is possible that the polygenic component, already recognized for testis cancer, is stronger than previously expected. Thus polygenic models with rare high/moderate- and low-risk variants could fit the familial risk and shape the germline genetic landscape of these cancers. Polygenic background may have clinical implications.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2024. The Author(s).</CopyrightInformation>"
3,"Laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery for leiomyosarcoma of the stomach: a case report with a review of the literature. Background Leiomyosarcoma is a rare tumor that could originate from the gastrointestinal tract, uterus, kidney, retroperitoneum, and the soft tissues of the extremities. It accounts for only 1% of all gastrointestinal mesenchymal tumors and primary leiomyosarcoma of the stomach is extremely rare. Most cases reported as leiomyosarcoma of the stomach before the development of KIT immunohistochemistry might be gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) of the stomach and only 18 cases of leiomyosarcoma of the stomach have been reported since early 2000s. We report here a patient with leiomyosarcoma of the stomach treated by laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS). Case presentation A 59-year-old man was referred to our hospital for an early gastric cancer, which was initially treated by endoscopic submucosal dissection. Six months after his initial treatment, a follow-up esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a small polypoid lesion at the lesser curvature of the proximal stomach, which appeared to be a hyperplastic polyp. However, one and a half years later, the lesion grew and showed more irregular surface. Biopsy at the time revealed smooth muscle cell proliferation suggestive of leiomyoma. Three years later, the lesion grew even larger and biopsy showed pleomorphic spindle cells. Immunohistochemical study showed positive staining for alpha-smooth muscle actin and desmin, but negative for c-kit and CD34. Ki-67 labeling index was nearly 60%. Based on these findings, the diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma was established. The patient subsequently underwent a partial gastrectomy by LECS. The patient is currently in good condition without recurrence or metastasis at 12 months after surgery. Conclusions Leiomyosarcoma of the stomach is extremely rare. This is the first report of leiomyosarcoma of the stomach treated by LECS. We could also follow its appearance change through endoscopic examination for 3 years."
3,"Thoracic stomach syndrome after whole-stomach esophagectomy for esophageal cancer mimicking tension pneumothorax: a case report Sudden onset of respiratory failure is one of the most fearful manifestations in intensive care units. Among the differential diagnoses of respiratory failure, tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening disease that requires immediate invasive intervention to drain the air from the thoracic cavity. However, other etiologies with manifestations similar to those of tension pneumothorax should also be considered after whole-stomach esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. We report a rare case of a patient with thoracic stomach syndrome mimicking tension pneumothorax after esophagectomy with whole-stomach reconstruction. A 49-year-old Asian woman was admitted to our intensive care unit after esophagectomy for esophageal cancer with whole-stomach reconstruction while under sedation and intubated. Despite initial stable vital signs, the patient rapidly developed tachypnea, low blood pressure, and low oxygen saturation. Chest radiography revealed a mediastinal shift and led to a presumptive diagnosis of tension pneumothorax. Hence, an aspiration catheter was inserted into the right pleural space. However, her clinical symptoms did not improve. Chest computed tomography was performed, which revealed a significantly distended reconstructed stomach that was compressing the nearby lung parenchyma. Her respiration improved immediately after nasogastric tube placement. After the procedure, we successfully extubated the patient. Similar to tension pneumothorax, thoracic stomach syndrome requires immediate drainage of air from the thoracic cavity. However, unlike tension pneumothorax, this condition requires nasogastric tube insertion, which is the only way to safely remove the accumulated air and avoid possible complications that could occur due to percutaneous drainage. For patient safety, it might be clinically important to place nasogastric tubes after esophagectomy with whole-stomach reconstruction, even if radiographic guidance is required. In addition, clinicians should consider thoracic stomach syndrome as one of the differential diagnoses of respiratory failure after whole-stomach esophagectomy."
3,"Bilateral metastatic ovarian tumors (Krukenberg’s tumors) in the course of stomach cancer Presented is a rare case of bilateral neoplastic metastases to the ovaries (Krukenberg's tumors) and to the fundus of the uterus which occurred in the course of stomach cancer in a 46-year-old female who was treated surgically in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology of the Regional Hospital in Slupsk. The patient was admitted secondary to bilateral ovarian masses. Her past medical history included peptic ulcer disease for a few years, confirmed by gastroscopic biopsy in July of 2000. The surgery performed in our department revealed bilateral ovarian tumors, each measuring about 10 cm in diameter, which were completely removed along with the fundus of the uterus. The intraoperative histologic diagnosis was ovarian cancer. No other macroscopic neoplastic changes were found during the surgery. During surgical removal of the gastrocolic ligament a group of enlarged lymph nodes at the greater curvature of the stomach in the proximity of the spleen was incidentally noticed. The intraoperative histology of the lymph nodes described metastatic neoplasia. Another intraoperative biopsy was also performed of the stomach because of atypical clinical presentation of the ovarian cancer. The pathologic diagnosis was stomach cancer. Upon the consultation with pathologists it was concluded that the primary tumor came from the stomach while the changes in the ovaries and lymph nodes were metastatic. Thus, the surgery consisted of total hysterectomy as well as removal of the stomach along with the spleen, gastrocolic ligament and greater omentum. The distal esophagus was anastomosed with the loop of jejunum. The final result of histologic exam confirmed the location of the primary neoplastic tumor in the stomach with metastases to both ovaries, the body of uterus, and lymph nodes at the greater curvature of the stomach."

3,"Microflora of gastric biopsies from patients with duodenal ulcer and gastric cancer: a comparative study of patients from Korea, Colombia, and the United States. It remains unclear why the spectrum of H. pylori-related diseases differs among different geographic regions. We examined the non-H. pylori contamination rates of the stomach in patients with duodenal ulcer or gastric adenocarcinoma from three different regions with different spectra of H. pylori-related diseases. Gastric biopsies were cultured from patients with duodenal ulcer or histologically proven gastric cancer from Seoul, Korea; Bogota, Colombia; and Houston, Texas. The frequency of non-H. pylori contamination was tallied in relation to the clinical diagnosis. Cultures from 247 duodenal ulcer patients and 165 patients with gastric cancer had bacterial growth. H. pylori was isolated from 207 (73.7%) patients with duodenal ulcer and 90 (47.1%) patients with gastric cancer (P 0.143 for DU, P > 0.190 for GC) between regions. The frequency of isolation ranged from 69% to 79% for DU patients and from 39% to 50% for gastric cancer patients. Non-H. pylori bacterial contamination was found more frequently (63%) in Colombian duodenal ulcer patients compared to 30% ulcer patients from the United States or Korea (P < 0.001). Non-H. pylori growth occurred in 50.8-75.5% of cancer patients and was significantly lower in US patients than in patients from either Colombia or Korea (P < 0.01). The geographic location as well as disease status affects the rate of H. pylori recovery and non-H. pylori contamination of the stomach and may play a role in the geographic differences in manifestation of H. pylori infection. The fact that the proportion of gastric cancer patients in the United States with non-H. pylori contamination was significantly less than that of Korea or Colombia shows that the notion of an almost universal increase in gastric microbial content in gastric adenocarcinoma should be reconsidered."
3,"Time trends of cancer incidence and mortality in Catalonia during 1993-2007. To describe time trends of cancer in Catalonia, Spain, during the period 1993–2007. Data have been provided by two population-based cancer registries, Girona and Tarragona, and the Catalan mortality registry. Cancer incidence in Catalonia has been estimated through modeling methods using data from these health structures. During 2003–2007, there were 20,042 cancer cases and 9,842 deaths per year among men and 13,673 new cancer cases and 5,882 deaths among women. The most frequent incident cancers among men were prostate (N = 4,258), lung (N = 3,021), colorectal (N = 3,007) and bladder (N = 2,238), whereas among women they were breast (N = 3,907), colorectal (N = 2,088), corpus uteri (N = 734) and lung (N = 527). During 1993–2007, age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) rose 1.2 % per year among men [prostate (6.3 %), testis (5.7 %), kidney (2.9 %), liver (2.2 %) and colorectal (2.1 %)]. ASIRs decreased for stomach (−2.9 %), oral cavity and pharynx (−2.8 %), larynx (−2.7 %) and esophagus (−2 %). Among women, ASIRs only rose for lung (5.2 %), kidney (3.1 %), oral cavity and pharynx (2.6 %) and thyroid (1.6 %). ASIRs decreased for corpus uteri (−2.3 %), stomach (−1.7 %) and ovary (−1.6 %). Cancer mortality decreased −1.3 % per year among men and −2.1 % among women during the same period. Among men, the decrease of incidence/mortality of tobacco-related tumors was related to a reduction of smoking prevalence. Among women, the stabilization of breast cancer incidence and the rise of lung cancer incidence are similar to that observed in most European regions. These results allow assessing the effectiveness of public health strategies and they pose new frontiers for cancer control in Catalonia."

3,"Outcome of patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of the stomach after gastrectomy: clinicopathologic study and reclassification according to the revised European-American lymphoma classification. Background. The best treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of the stomach is still uncertain. The revised European-American lymphoma (REAL) classification has helped to define new, potentially more appropriate classification schemes for gastric lymphomas. Methods. Fifty-one resected gastric lymphomas were reclassified according to the REAL classification, and the efficacy of multimodal treatment was examined retrospectively. The principal treatment plan consisted of: (1) surgical resection of the stomach with lymph node dissection, followed by (2) systemic chemotherapy, mainly using the cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/vincristine/prednisone (CHOP) regimen. Results. According to the Ann Arbor classification, 27 patients had stage IE, 19 had stage IIE, and 5 had stage IV NHL. Using the REAL classification, we diagnosed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBL) in 23 patients, marginal zone B-cell (low-grade mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue [MALT]-type) lymphoma in 22, follicle center lymphoma in 4, mantle cell lymphoma in 1, and peripheral T-cell lymphoma in 1 patient. Nine of the 51 patients relapsed, and 8 patients with DLBL died of cancer. Survival rates at 5 years after surgery were 96.0% for stage IE, 83.3% for stage IIE, and 87.0% for all patients. Univariate analysis indicated that the tumor histology (according to the REAL classification), depth of invasion, degree of nodal involvement, Ann Arbor staging, and chemotherapy had an impact on patient outcome (P = 0.0018; P = 0.0002; P = 0.0308; P = 0.0016, and P = 0.0118, respectively). Conclusions. These data reveal that gastric NHL, especially of the low-grade MALT-type, often remains localized and has a good prognosis after surgery. The REAL classification was useful for classifying new categories of NHL, including the MALT-type, in the clinical setting, and for determining the optimal treatment modality for gastric NHL."
3,"Function-Preserving Gastrectomy for Early Gastric Cancer The number of early gastric cancer (EGC) cases has been increasing because of improved diagnostic procedures. Applications of function-preserving gastric cancer surgery may therefore also be increasing because of its low incidence of lymph node metastasis, excellent survival rates, and the possibility of less-invasive procedures such as laparoscopic gastrectomy being used in combination. Pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG) with radical lymph node dissection is one such function-preserving procedure that has been applied for EGC, with the indications, limitations, and survival benefits of PPG already reported in several retrospective studies. Laparoscopy-assisted proximal gastrectomy has also been applied for EGC of the upper third of the stomach, although this procedure can be associated with the 2 major problems of reflux esophagitis and carcinoma arising in the gastric stump. In the patient with EGC in the upper third of the stomach, laparoscopy-assisted subtotal gastrectomy with a preserved very small stomach may provide a better quality of life for the patients and fewer postoperative complications. Finally, the laparoscopy endoscopy cooperative surgery procedure combines endoscopic submucosal dissection with laparoscopic gastric wall resection, which prevents excessive resection and deformation of the stomach after surgery and was recently applied for EGC cases without possibility of lymph node metastasis. Function-preserving laparoscopic gastrectomy is recommended for the treatment of EGC if the indication followed by accurate diagnosis is strictly confirmed. Preservation of remnant stomach sometimes causes severe postoperative dysfunctions such as delayed gastric retention in PPG, esophageal reflux in PG, and gastric stump carcinoma in the remnant stomach. Moreover, these techniques present technical difficulties to the surgeon. Although many retrospective studies showed the functional benefit or oncological safety of function-preserving gastrectomy, further prospective studies using large case series are necessary."
3,"Analyses on cancer incidence and mortality in Huai’an area, China, from 2009 to 2011 The aim of the study was to investigate the cancer incidence and mortality in Huai’an area, China, from 2009 to 2011. The data about cancer incidence and mortality were provided by Huai’an Cancer Registry, China. Incidence and mortality rates, and standardized rates were calculated by age, gender, areas (urban and rural areas of Huai’an) and cancer sites. The crude incidence rate for all cancer sites was 205.60/105 and the standardized incidence rate was 166.22/105. Both the crude and standardized rates were higher in urban area than in rural area for both sexes. The incidence rates increased in people aged 40 and over, and the peak ages of incidence were between 70–75 in both males and females. The crude mortality rate for all cancer sites was 153.88/105 and the standardized mortality rate was 122.14/105. Both the crude and standardized rates were similar in urban and rural areas for both men and women. The mortality rates were at low level under the age 50 in both sexes, but increased after the age 50, reaching the peak at the ages of 80–85 in both males and females. The top 10 most common cancer sites in rank were esophagus, stomach, lung, liver, colon-rectum, breast, pancreas, cervix uteri, brain and central nervous system, and leukemia, accounting for 87.56% of all cancers. The top 10 most leading causes of cancer death in order were cancers of esophagus, lung, liver, stomach, colon-rectum, pancreas, brain and central nervous system, leukemia, breast and lymphoma, accounting for 90.53% of all cancer deaths. Cancer is one kind of major diseases threatening people’s health in Huai’an area, China. Cancer prevention and control should be enhanced, especially for esophageal cancer."
3,"SCDb: an integrated database of stomach cancer Stomach cancer (SC) is a type of cancer, which is derived from the stomach mucous membrane. As there are non-specific symptoms or no noticeable symptoms observed at the early stage, newly diagnosed SC cases usually reach an advanced stage and are thus difficult to cure. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to develop an integrated database of SC. SC-related genes were identified through literature mining and by analyzing the publicly available microarray datasets. Using the RNA-seq, miRNA-seq and clinical data downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves for all the SC-related genes were generated and analyzed. The miRNAs (miRanda, miRTarget2, PicTar, PITA and TargetScan databases), SC-related miRNAs (HMDD and miR2Disease databases), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs, dbSNP database), and SC-related SNPs (ClinVar database) were also retrieved from the indicated databases. Moreover, gene_disease (OMIM and GAD databases), copy number variation (CNV, DGV database), methylation (PubMeth database), drug (WebGestalt database), and transcription factor (TF, TRANSFAC database) analyses were performed for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In total, 9990 SC-related genes (including 8347 up-regulated genes and 1643 down-regulated genes) were identified, among which, 65 genes were further confirmed as SC-related genes by performing enrichment analysis. Besides this, 457 miRNAs, 20 SC-related miRNAs, 1570 SNPs, 108 SC-related SNPs, 419 TFs, 44,605 CNVs, 3404 drug-associated genes, 63 genes with methylation, and KM survival curves of 20,264 genes were obtained. By integrating these datasets, an integrated database of stomach cancer, designated as SCDb, (available at http://www.stomachcancerdb.org/) was established. As a comprehensive resource for human SC, SCDb database will be very useful for performing SC-related research in future, and will thus promote the understanding of the pathogenesis of SC."
3,"Cellular and molecular pathology of gastric carcinoma and precursor lesions: A critical review. The cellular and molecular pathology of gastric cancer and its precursors are reviewed and discussed. Gastric carcinogenesis is a multistep phenomenon, beginning with precancerous conditions. Among these, adenoma is a direct precursor, because of the dysplastic nature of its cells. However, gastric adenoma is relatively rare. Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) is the most common precancerous condition, in which intestinal metaplasia often occurs. Carcinoma develops in CAG through stages of hyperplasia and dysplasia involving both metaplastic and non-metaplastic glands. Molecular alterations, including replication error and p53 and APC gene mutation and aneuploidy have been found in some of these conditions, confirming their role in carcinogenesis. Carcinomas of the stomach are heterogeneous in cellular composition. Both intestinal and gastric types of cells are found in all types of tumors, indicating the unique characteristics of gastric cancer. Many molecular lesions have been found in gastric carcinomas. Basic changes involve replication errors, telomerase activity, and aberrant CD44 transcripts. Many other changes often show differences in the frequency of their occurrence between the two major histological types of gastric carcinoma: well differentiated versus poorly differentiated, or intestinal type versus diffuse type. The timing and frequency of these changes in the stomach differ from the timing and frequency in colonic carcinogeneis. Pathological evaluation remains reliable and meaningful, in basic research as well as clinical management. To obtain correlation with molecular alterations, the need for detailed pathologic classification of gastric carcinoma is recognized, taking into account its biologic behavior and grades of cell differentiation.The cellular and molecular pathology of gastric cancer and its precursors are reviewed and discussed. Gastric carcinomas are unique in their heterogeneity in both cellular composition and molecular changes."
3,"Salt intake, cured meat consumption, refrigerator use and stomach cancer incidence: a prospective cohort study (Netherlands) Objective: Many case-control studies have reported that salt and cured meat intake are positively, and refrigerator use is inversely, associated with stomach cancer risk. In the current prospective study these associations were evaluated. Methods: The Netherlands Cohort Study consisted of 120,852 men and women ages 55-69 years at baseline in 1986. Salt exposure was measured by calculating mean daily sodium intake (dietary salt) from 150 food items and by specific salt questions. After 6.3 years of follow-up, 282 incident stomach cancer cases were available for analyses. Case-cohort analyses were based on the 282 cases and 3123 subcohort members. Results: In multivariate analyses adjusted for age, sex, smoking, education, stomach disorders, history of stomach cancer in the family, rate ratios (RR) for increasing quintiles of energy-adjusted intake of dietary salt were 1.00, 1.49, 1.03, 1.54 and 1.18, respectively (p trend = 0.43). An inverse association was found between stomach cancer and salt added at the hot meal (p trend = 0.04). For salt added to home-made soup, use of salt at the table, salt preference and duration of refrigerator use, no associations were observed. Positive associations were found for bacon (RR highest/lowest intake = 1.33; 95% CI = 1.03-1.71) and other sliced cold meat (RR highest/lowest intake = 1.29; 95% CI = 0.96-1.72), but not for smoked sausage, total cold meats, rashers/bacon, boiled ham and smoked beef/pork loin roll. Separate analyses among subjects with self-reported stomach disorders revealed higher RR of stomach cancer for dietary salt and several types of cured meat. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that intake of dietary salt and several types of cured meat were weakly positively associated with stomach cancer risk."
3,"To resect or not resect in metastatic gastric cancer: that is the question! Last week we discussed 5 patients with gastric cancer at a meeting of our interdisciplinary tumor board. With the evidence we have and the recent publication of multidisciplinary treatment guidelines [1, 2] most decisions were easy to take and we achieved a great consensus with our colleagues from surgery and radiation oncology about our treatment standards. But one case concerned us a lot and we do not know yet if we took the right decision. A 46-year old man, born in Russia who had emigrated to Germany as a child–a freelance carpenter and father of 2 children– presented 5 months ago with a swollen painless lymph node at the right side of the neck. Histopathologic assessment revealed an adenocarcinoma of the intestinal type. Further examination showed a distal stomach cancer infiltrating the duodenum, two borderline enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinum, and several enlarged lymph nodes along the aorta from the diaphragm down to the iliac bifurcation. These nodes were all positive on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET). We treated this patient with docetaxel, 5-fluorouracil, and cisplatin [3]. He tolerated the treatment well but then he developed sensory neuropathy in the fingers and toes during the last cycle and complained about increasing taste disorder and about fatigue. The last computed tomography (CT) scan showed a good response in the lymph nodes. The mediastinum was normal and some enlarged lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum were no longer avid for FDG on the PET-CT. On endoscopy we still found a vital nonobstructing tumor in the distal stomach infiltrating the descending part of the duodenum. The patient had no difficulties in feeding himself and did not complain about"
3,"Employment as butcher and cancer risk in a record-linkage study from Sweden. Objective: To investigate the risk of cancer among butchers and other meat workers in a large record-linkage study from Sweden. ; Methods: The Swedish Cancer Environment Register III contains nationwide data on cancer incidence during 1971–1989 for all residents, by occupation and industry of employment as reported at the 1960 and 1970 censuses. We identified 25,049 men classified as butchers or meat workers at either census. We used as a comparison group the remaining part of the active male population, after exclusion of workers with direct contact with animals. ; Results: Butchers in the meat industry had a slight increase in the risk of cancer (relative risk [RR] 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0–1.3), which was due to an increased risk of cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0–2.7), stomach (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1–2.7), larynx (RR 1.4, 95% CI 0.6–3.4), and lung (RR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1–1.9). The risk of stomach cancer was highest during the first 5 years of the study, and among butchers from urban areas. No temporal or geographic variations were seen for lung cancer risk, with elevations restricted to squamous cell carcinoma. An increased risk of stomach, laryngeal and lung cancers was present in butchers and meat workers outside the meat industry. There was no clear indication of an increased risk of other neoplasms. ; Conclusions: The increased risk of oral, laryngeal, lung and stomach cancers among Swedish butchers may be at least partly due to confounding by tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and other lifestyle factors. However, exposures in the meat industry (e.g., viruses, nitrosamines, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) may contribute the elevated cancer risks."
3,"Cancer-directed surgery for localized disease: decreased use in the elderly. Background: Previous studies report underuse of radiation and chemotherapy in the elderly, yet few have examined the rates of use (or underuse) of surgery. Using national data, we examined rates of surgical resection for patients with local-stage cancers. Methods: By using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (1988–1997), patients (≧40 years) were identified with localized adenocarcinoma of the breast, esophagus, stomach, pancreas, colon, or rectum; non–small-cell lung carcinoma; and sarcoma (n = 200,360). Rates of cancer-directed surgery (CDS) were compared across age groups (at 5-year intervals). Multivariate regression was used to identify predictors of receipt of CDS in each tumor group. Results: Rates of CDS declined steadily with increasing age for all nine localized tumors. Most striking were the low rates of CDS for patients >70 years with esophagus, stomach, pancreas, and lung cancers (range, 0%–83%). However, CDS rates were >90% for breast and colon and >84% for rectal cancer in all age groups. Multivariate regression found lower odds of CDS for elderly patients for all cancers except colon. For example, age significantly decreased the odds of receiving CDS beginning at 60 years for lung cancer (odds ratio [OR], .550; P = .03), at 70 years for liver cancer (OR, .109; P = .003), and at 80 years for pancreatic cancer (OR, .120; P < .05). Conclusions: Although CDS for localized disease is being performed regularly in the elderly for some cancers (e.g. breast, colon, and rectum), this analysis shows that elderly patients are not receiving surgery for many potentially curable cancers. Whether these rates are appropriate or too low requires further evaluation. This is particularly essential because our population is aging."
3,"The risk of second malignancy after adjuvant chemotherapy for stomach cancer. BACKGROUND: Although many trials have been conducted to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) for patients with stomach cancer, the benefits of ACT remain unclear. Moreover, some authors have reported that ACT increased the incidence of second malignancy. The risk of second malignancy was evaluated in patients who underwent treatment for stomach cancer in the past 20 years at Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases.METHODS: The study population consisted of 1925 patients who underwent gastrectomies for stomach cancer between the years 1978 and 1992 and who received follow-up examinations to check for second malignancies. They included 1114 patients who underwent surgery only (group A) and 811 who underwent surgery and received chemotherapy (group B). The observed incidence of second malignancy (O) was compared with the expected incidence (E), calculated by the person-year method, using data from the Cancer Registry in Osaka.RESULTS: The average follow-up period was 7.99 years. The total number of patients with a second malignancy was 127 (men, 97; women, 30); 72 patients had the second malignancy in digestive organs; 27 in respiratory organs; and 28 in other organs. The relative risks of a second malignancy in group A and B patients were 1.05 and 1.02 (differences between the two groups were not significant). The relative risks of a second malignancy in patients who received ACT with 5-fluorouracil, Tegafur and Uracil, and FT207 were 0.79, 1.01, and 1.06, respectively (differences between the groups were not significant).CONCLUSION: The risk of second malignancy after chemotherapy for stomach cancer was not high in comparison with the expected incidence. Adjuvant chemotherapy did not increase the risk of a second malignancy."
3,"Incidence and mortality rates of selected infection-related cancers in Puerto Rico and in the United States Background: In 2002, 17.8% of the global cancer burden was attributable to infections. This study assessed the agestandardized incidence and mortality rates of stomach, liver, and cervical cancer in Puerto Rico (PR) for the period 19922003 and compared them to those of Hispanics (USH), non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), and non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) in the United States (US). Methods: Age-standardized rates [ASR(World)] were calculated based on cancer incidence and mortality data from the PR Cancer Central Registry and SEER, using the direct method and the world population as the standard. Annual percent changes (APC) were calculated using the Poisson regression model from 1992-2003. Results: The incidence and mortality rates from stomach, liver and cervical cancer were lower in NHW than PR; with the exception of mortality from cervical cancer which was similar in both populations. Meanwhile, the incidence rates of stomach, liver and cervical cancers were similar between NHB and PR; except for NHB women who had a lower incidence rate of liver cancer than women in PR. NHB had a lower mortality from liver cancer than persons in PR, and similar mortality from stomach cancer. Conclusions: The burden of liver, stomach, and cervical cancer in PR compares to that of USH and NHB and continues to be a public health priority. Public health efforts are necessary to further decrease the burden of cancers associated to infections in these groups, the largest minority population groups in the US. Future studies need to identify factors that may prevent infections with cancer-related agents in these populations. Strategies to increase the use of preventive strategies, such as vaccination and screening, among minority populations should also be developed."
3,"Machine learning-based approaches for cancer prediction using microbiome data. Emerging evidence of the relationship between the microbiome composition and the development of numerous diseases, including cancer, has led to an increasing interest in the study of the human microbiome. Technological breakthroughs regarding DNA sequencing methods propelled microbiome studies with a large number of samples, which called for the necessity of more sophisticated data-analytical tools to analyze this complex relationship. The aim of this work was to develop a machine learning-based approach to distinguish the type of cancer based on the analysis of the tissue-specific microbial information, assessing the human microbiome as valuable predictive information for cancer identification. For this purpose, Random Forest algorithms were trained for the classification of five types of cancer-head and neck, esophageal, stomach, colon, and rectum cancers-with samples provided by The Cancer Microbiome Atlas database. One versus all and multi-class classification studies were conducted to evaluate the discriminative capability of the microbial data across increasing levels of cancer site specificity, with results showing a progressive rise in difficulty for accurate sample classification. Random Forest models achieved promising performances when predicting head and neck, stomach, and colon cancer cases, with the latter returning accuracy scores above 90% across the different studies conducted. However, there was also an increased difficulty when discriminating esophageal and rectum cancers, failing to differentiate with adequate results rectum from colon cancer cases, and esophageal from head and neck and stomach cancers. These results point to the fact that anatomically adjacent cancers can be more complex to identify due to microbial similarities. Despite the limitations, microbiome data analysis using machine learning may advance novel strategies to improve cancer detection and prevention, and decrease disease burden."
3,"Mass-like Dieulafoy's lesion associated with advanced gastric cancer at the antrum of stomach: a case report and literature review. Dieulafoy’s lesion, also known as a caliber-persistent artery, is a shallow, small, and rare lesion that occurs along the lesser curvature of proximal stomach. It is rare for a Dieulafoy’s lesion to present as a mass-like lesion that coexists with gastric cancer. To our best knowledge, we report the first case and histopathological pictures of a mass-like Dieulafoy’s lesion coexisting with advanced gastric cancer in the antrum of the stomach. A 57-year-old female presented with a 6-month history of intermittent epigastric dull pain and dyspepsia. Subsequent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a friable mass that was located between the distal antrum and the pyloric ring. Biopsy revealed it to be an intestinal type adenocarcinoma. Subtotal gastrectomy was performed after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Grossly, a large irregular plaque-like tumor lesion was noted at the anterior wall of the distal antrum and pylorus ring near the lesser curvature, measuring 5.6 × 4.8 × 1.0 cm. Histopathological examination of the resected stomach revealed that the plaque-like lesion largely consisted of numerous abnormally large-caliber and tortuous arteries in the submucosa. The increased fibrosis of the submucosa resulted in the formation of elevated plaque. The intestinal type adenocarcinoma was noted to be largely confined to the mucosa layer, with focal submucosal and muscular propria involvement. The patient was discharged one week after the subtotal gastrectomy, and she was alive and well 17 months after discharge, with no major complications. This is the first case of a mass-like Dieulafoy’s lesion coexisting with advanced gastric cancer at the distal antrum area. This case highlights the possibility of life-threatening gastric bleeding after mucosal resection or biopsy that could be encountered by endoscopists."
3,"Using a Chinese time trade-off approach to explore the health utility level and quality of life of cancer patients in urban China: a multicentre cross-sectional study A quality of life assessment is useful in identifying a specific health impact on patients who are suffering from various medical conditions. This study estimated the quality of life among patients with cancers of the lungs, breast, colorectum, oesophagus, liver, and stomach in urban China and evaluates the associated factors. This study employed a random cluster sampling strategy to recruit patients with lung, breast, colorectal, oesophageal, liver, or stomach cancer from eleven third-grade class-A (the highest level) hospitals in Beijing between October 2013 and May 2014. We performed a quality of life survey that included solicitation of sociodemographic and clinical information and the use of a EuroQoL five-dimension three-level questionnaire. We applied the Chinese time trade-off method to calculate the health utility values, which were transformed into binary variables (using the median as the cut-off). In addition, multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to examine the factors associated with the quality of life. A total of 637 patients (91 with lung cancer, 152 with breast cancer, 60 with colorectal cancer, 108 with oesophageal cancer, 154 with liver cancer, and 72 with stomach cancer) were included in this study; the medians of the health utility values were 0.780, 0.800, 0.800, 0.860, 0.800, and 0.870, respectively. The most common concerns for patients of all six cancer types were pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. The reported health status of patients was associated with various demographic and clinical variables. This study highlighted that pain relief and psychological support are important aspects of patient management for those with these types of cancer. Individuals with factors associated with a poorer quality of life should be targets for additional support."
3,"Laparoscopic wedge resection for gastrointestinal stromal tumors of the stomach: initial experience. Surgery for gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) of the stomach is now frequently performed using a laparoscopic approach. We investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of laparoscopy in the management of GIST of the stomach. We reviewed the records of 12 consecutive patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for GIST between April 2000 and April 2004, and compared their short-term outcomes with those of patients who underwent open surgery. All laparoscopic wedge resections were done using stapling devices and 3–4 trocars, often with the aid of intraoperative gastroscopy. We examined all patients preoperatively using various diagnostic modalities, including endoscopic ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). A laparoscopic approach was not indicated if the tumor was located near the cardia or pylorus or if it was ≧5 cm in diameter. A specific diagnosis of GIST was obtained preoperatively by EUS-FNA in 10 of the 12 patients. The median diameter of the lesion was 2.7 cm (range, 1.5–4.8 cm). Although intraoperative complications were encountered in two patients, conversion to open surgery was not required, and we were able to perform complete tumor excision with negative surgical margins in all patients. The median operative time was 100 min (range, 65–180 min), similar to that for open surgery. First flatus was passed earlier, and the interval to resuming oral intake was shorter than after open surgery. No major postoperative complications such as leakage developed, and the median postoperative hospital stay was 7 days (range, 5–12 days). All diagnoses made by EUS-FNA were confirmed by immunohisto-pathological evaluation of resected specimens. Laparoscopic wedge resection is a feasible treatment option for GISTs of the stomach if the lesion is <5 cm in diameter."
3,"Diagnosis of gastric cancer by MDCT gastrography: diagnostic characteristics and management potential Gastric cancer is regarded as the fifth most frequent tumor globally but the third most common fatal illness. As early as possible, we diagnose cancer stomach especially at early stages, the higher the rate of life. Nevertheless, most cases are diagnosed at late cases where surgery is not of the same benefit at early stages because of clinically indefinite symptoms. The prospective study goal is to estimate the role of MDCT in diagnosis and staging of cancer stomach. In our study, it was found that there was a high relationship between pathological and CT staging by using MPR. CT with MPR was specific and accurate in diagnosis of all stages of gastric cancer with specificity ranged between 93 and 97% and accuracy ranged between 90 and 92.5%. However, it showed lowest sensitivity in diagnosis of stage 1 of gastric cancer. On the other hand, it showed highest sensitivity (90%) in diagnosis of stage IV as well as we found that MPR and VR of MDCT are much more accurate (92.5%) than multi-detector computed tomography axial images (80%) in the diagnosis of all stages of gastric cancer with the difference between the two sequences was significant (P = 0.009). Our results demonstrate that preoperative MDCT with contrast filling technique for abdomen and pelvis evaluates the local disease process of gastric cancer as well as the potential areas of spread. This information is vital in choosing between palliative or radical surgery. MPR and VR help in the assessment of tumor extension and considered as a highly representative prognostic value. Making it the imaging modality of choice in diagnosis and staging of gastric cancers."
3,"Green-tea consumption and risk of stomach cancer: a population-based case-control study in Shanghai, China The effect of drinking Chinese green tea on the risk of stomach cancer was evaluated in a population-based case-control study conducted in Shanghai, China, from October 1991 to December 1993. Eligible cases were incident cases of primary stomach cancer diagnosed during the study period among residents of Hongkou district and Nanhui county aged under 80 years. Controls were selected from the same street or commune where the case resided and were matched to the cases on age (within three years) and gender. A total of 711 cases and 711 matched controls, more than 90 percent of the eligible subjects, completed the interview. Information was obtained on the types of tea used, age when habitual tea drinking started, frequency of new batches of tea leaves used per day, number of cups brewed from each batch, total duration of drinking for each batch, strength and temperature of the tea consumed. Statistical analysis was based on modelling through conditional logistic regression. After adjusting for age, gender, place of residence, education, birthplace, alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking, the odds ratio (OR) comparing drinkers of green tea with nondrinkers was 0.71 (95 percent confidence interval = 0.54–0.93). The adjusted OR decreased with increasing number of new batches of the green tea consumed each day (P value trend = 0.006). With the largest series of stomach cancer cases to date, this study found green-tea consumption associated with lower risk of stomach cancer. Among drinkers of green tea, the risk of stomach cancer did not depend on the age when habitual green-tea drinking started. Green tea may disrupt gastric carcinogenesis at both the intermediate and the late stages."
3,"Redefining early gastric cancer. The problem is that current definitions of early gastric cancer allow the inclusion of regional lymph node metastases. The increasing use of endoscopic submucosal dissection to treat early gastric cancer is a concern because regional lymph nodes are not addressed. The aim of the study was thus to critically evaluate current evidence with regard to tumour-specific factors associated with lymph node metastases in “early gastric cancer” to develop a more precise definition and improve clinical management. A systematic and comprehensive search of major reference databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and the Cochrane Library) was undertaken using a combination of text words “early gastric cancer”, “lymph node metastasis”, “factors”, “endoscopy”, “surgery”, “lymphadenectomy” “mucosa”, “submucosa”, “lymphovascular invasion”, “differentiated”, “undifferentiated” and “ulcer”. All available publications that described tumour-related factors associated with lymph node metastases in early gastric cancer were included. The initial search yielded 1494 studies, of which 42 studies were included in the final analysis. Over time, the definition of early gastric cancer has broadened and the indications for endoscopic treatment have widened. The mean frequency of lymph node metastases increased on the basis of depth of infiltration (mucosa 6 % vs. submucosa 28 %), presence of lymphovascular invasion (absence 9 % vs. presence 53 %), tumour differentiation (differentiated 13 % vs. undifferentiated 34 %) and macroscopic type (elevated 13 % vs. flat 26 %) and tumour diameter (≤2 cm 8 % vs. >2 cm 25 %). There is a need to re-examine the diagnosis and staging of early gastric cancer to ensure that patients with one or more identifiable risk factor for lymph node metastases are not denied appropriate chemotherapy and surgical resection."

3,"Endoscopic submucosal dissection for early neoplastic lesions in the surgically altered stomach: a systematic review and meta-analysis. Endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for early gastric cancer is highly effective and well established. Performing ESD in the surgically altered stomach (SAS) is challenging. The aim of this meta-analysis is to assess the safety and efficacy of ESD for patients with early neoplastic lesions occurring in the SAS with a subgroup analysis of lesions occurring on the suture line compared to non-suture line lesions and outcomes in the remnant stomach compared to the gastric tube. We performed a literature search of the PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL electronic databases from January 2000 to November 2017 for articles reporting the safety and efficacy of ESD in the surgically altered stomach. SAS was defined as the remnant stomach following gastrectomy and gastric tube following esophagectomy. Meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager version 5.3 software. A total of 21 articles, with 903 lesions occurring in the remnant stomach or gastric tube, were included in this study. There was no significant difference between en bloc (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91–1.08), curative resection (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.84–1.26), or bleeding rates (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.18–10.72) between lesions in the remnant stomach and gastric tube. However, perforation was significantly higher in the gastric tube (RR 5.19, 95% 1.27–21.25). Suture line lesions had a significantly higher risk of perforation (RR 4.55, 95% CI 2.13–9.74). ESD for early neoplastic lesions occurring in the SAS is a safe and efficacious with similar en bloc and curative resection rates compared to the anatomically normal stomach. ESD for lesions on the suture line or in the gastric tube is associated with an increased risk of perforation which can be managed endoscopically."
3,"A resected case of neuroendocrine carcinoma of the stomach with unusual lymph node metastasis Gastric endocrine cell carcinoma is a relatively rare tumor. We experienced a case of early gastric cancer in which an endocrine cell carcinoma was identified within a differentiated adenocarcinoma, and a component of this endocrine cell carcinoma had metastasized to lymph nodes of the stomach. In its 2010 revision regarding digestive system tumors, WHO classified cancer cells with characteristics of both glandular system cells and neuroendocrine cells as mixed adeno neuroendocrine carcinoma (MANEC) under the neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC) category. In this case, we observed an endocrine cell carcinoma continuous with an intramucosal differentiated adenocarcinoma, and cancer cells with an irregular gland duct structure were observed in the proliferative portion of the submucosal tissue. In addition, there was a 35 mm size lymph node metastasis in the lesser curvature of the stomach consisting entirely of poorly differentiated cancer cells with polymorphic, highly atypical nuclei and scant cytoplasm. Immunohistological analysis showed that the endocrine carcinoma in the gastric mucosa was chromogranin A positive and the infiltrated area of the submucosal tissue was also chromogranin A positive. The lymph node metastasis was positive not only for chromogranin A, but also for Synaptophysin and CD56. Furthermore, the Ki67 labeling index was high at approximately 80 % for the gastric endocrine cell carcinoma and approximately 90 % for the lymph node metastases. Until now, there are no reports related to the patients with early gastric cancer accompanied with lymph node metastasis of MANEC. This case is very interested in considering the mechanism of lymph node metastasis of MANEC. The patient has shown no sign of recurrence for 1 year and 4 months after postoperative chemotherapy."
3,"4. Cancers attributable to dietary factors in the UK in 2010: I. Low consumption of fruit and vegetables There is considerable controversy over the protective effect of diets rich in fruit, vegetables and fibre, and the respective roles of the different components (including micronutrients such as folate). The report of the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Nutrition Policy (COMA) (Department of Health, 1998) recommended increasing consumption of all of them, an advice that seems to have motivated the Department of Health in promoting its ‘5-a-day’ programme (Department of Health, 2005). The original consensus of the probable decrease in risk of several cancers of the gastrointestinal tract (oral cavity and pharynx, oesophagus, stomach and colorectum) associated with increased consumption of fruit and vegetables (WHO/FAO, 2003) was based on the results of multiple case–control studies and a few prospective studies. The IARC Handbook of Cancer Prevention (IARC, 2003) concludes its review of the evidence as follows: There is limited evidence for cancer-preventive effect of consumption of fruit and vegetables for cancers of the mouth and pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, colorectum, larynx, lung, ovary (vegetables only), bladder (fruit only) and kidney.; There is inadequate evidence for a cancer-preventive effect of consumption of fruit and vegetables for all other sites.; More specifically, this evidence indicates that higher intake of fruit probably lowers the risk of cancers of the oesophagus, stomach and lung, while higher intake of vegetables probably lowers the risk of cancers of the oesophagus and colorectum.; Likewise a higher intake of fruit possibly lowers the risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, colorectum, larynx, kidney and urinary bladder. An increase in consumption of vegetables possibly reduces the risk of cancers of the mouth, pharynx, stomach, larynx, lung, ovary and kidney."
3,"Multiple Gastrointestinal Cancers in a Single Patient—a Rare Clinical Entity Multiple gastrointestinal cancers in a single patient is a rare entity. In our study, we are showing the clinical presentation and management of these patients. A fifty-nine-year-old asthenic male (already treated case of metachronous colorectal cancer in 2008 and 2011) presented with complaints of generalized weakness and fatigue. Strong family history was present with two of his first-degree relatives having diagnosed with gastrointestinal cancer at the age < 50 years with one of them having stomach carcinoma and another with GEJ tumors. On evaluation, upper GI endoscopy revealed growth at cardia and endoscopic biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma. Radiological evaluation with PET-CT scan revealed proximal stomach growth with regional lymphadenopathy. Patient was optimized for surgery and underwent D2 total gastrectomy, distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy with Roux-en-Y oesophago-jejunal anastomosis. Pathological stage revealed pT4N2M0, moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of proximal stomach, both distal and proximal cut margins negative for tumor, LVI present with no perineural invasion, and 5/18 lymph nodes dissected were positive for malignancy. Genetic testing needs to be considered in this patient (modified Bethesda guidelines and IGCLC criteria). Familial gastric cancer are of two types: (a) hereditary diffuse gastric cancer syndrome, (b) familial intestinal type gastric cancer. Approximately 5% of patients have germ-line mutations—AD LYNCH syndrome, hereditary breast-ovarian cancer, and polyposis and non-polyposis syndrome. Once diagnosed in localized advanced stage, the best treatment is R0 resection though overall prognosis in these patients is very poor. So it is rationale to find such families with elevated risk and to do active surveillance for early diagnosis and providing prophylactic gastrectomies to them as it has proven to be beneficial in hereditary form of gastric cancer."

3,"Metastasis to the lymph nodes along the proper hepatic artery from adenocarcinoma of the stomach The study sought the significance of resecting lymph nodes along the proper hepatic artery (station 12a) in gastric cancer surgery and the possibility of predicting station 12a involvement from clinicopathological factors or metastatic status in other regional lymph nodes of the stomach. Patients who underwent D2 gastrectomy were assessed retrospectively. Survivals were compared between the patients with and without station 12a metastasis among the patients with metastasis to any regional lymph nodes. Clinicopathological factors correlating with station 12a metastasis were sought by logistic regression analyses. The possibility of a predictor for station 12a metastasis was evaluated in each regional lymph node station. Metastasis to station 12a was observed in 21 of 1260 patients (1.7 %). The 5-year overall survival rate was 62.7 % in the patients without station 12a metastasis and 54.4 % in the patients with station 12a metastasis (P = 0.164). The lower third (OR 3.810, 95 % CI 1.507–9.631, P = 0.005), the lesser curvature or circumferential involvement (OR 4.099, 95 % CI 1.178–14.259, P = 0.027) and 81.5 mm or larger tumor diameter (OR 2.959, 95 % CI 1.212–7.224, P = 0.017) were identified as the independent risk factors of station 12a metastasis. Station 11p significantly correlated with station 12a metastasis (OR 13.469, 95 % CI 1.437–126.216, P = 0.023). The false negatives as predictors of station 12a metastasis ranged from 14.3 % (station 6) to 100.0 % (station 11d) for each regional lymph node station. Given the difficulty in predicting station 12a metastasis and the favorable survival in the patients with metastasis to the nodes, station 12a should be resected in a D2 gastrectomy."
3,"A Gastric Cancer Following Sleeve Gastrectomy with Transit Bipartition Surgery Gastric cancer is still a major cancer worldwide and more than one million cases of gastric cancer are diagnosed each year. It is known that stomach cancer is increasing, especially after surgical interventions to the stomach. Due to obesity and diabetes, the most common diseases of our age, obesity and metabolic surgery have been performed widely in recent years. Here in, It is aimed to report an interesting case of gastric cancer located on the stapler line in a short time after Sleeve Gastrectomy with Transit Bipartition operation. A 60-year-old male patient consulted to the general surgery outpatient clinic with complaints of intermittent epigastric pain and bloating. Sleeve Gastrectomy with Transit Bipartition operation was performed 3 years ago for morbid obesity and Type 2 diabetes. During endoscopy, a mucosal irregularity was detected in the gastric corpus. Histopathological examination of the biopsies revealed mucinous adenocarcinoma (signet ring cell type). Total gastrectomy was performed and the patient was discharged without any problem. We conducted a literature review of the studies published in English on PubMed, Medline and Google Scholarly databases on the development of cancer after Sleeve Gastrectomy with Transit Bipartition operation. Although we found many cases with gastric cancer in the follow-up only after Sleeve Gastrectomy, we did not find any cancer in the follow-up after Sleeve Gastrectomy with Transit Bipartition operation. Due to this feature, this case is the first case reported in the literature. In the postoperative follow-up of patients who have undergone Sleeve Gastrectomy with Transit Bipartition operation, we should be careful about gastric cancer, and we should not refrain from examination on the slightest suspicion."

3,"Effects of the interleukin-1β-511 C/T gene polymorphism on the risk of gastric cancer in the context of the relationship between race and H. pylori infection: a meta-analysis of 20,000 subjects The interleukin (IL)-1β-511 C/T polymorphism has been shown to be functional and to contribute to the risk of gastric cancer. However, the relationship between the IL-1β-511 C/T polymorphism and gastric carcinogenesis remains inconclusive. A systematical electronic search was conducted of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases. A random and a fixed effects model were exploited to estimate summary odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were carried out with respect to ethnicity, quality assessment scores, control sources, genotyping methods, cancer histopathology and location, and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. A total of 45 studies containing 9,066 cases of gastric cancer and 11,192 control subjects satisfied the inclusion criteria. The IL-1β-511 C/T polymorphism was found to enhance the risk of stomach cancer for overall and HWE-satisfying studies. Asians showed a positive relationship in both the overall and HWE-satisfying groups, whereas Caucasians did not. Based on subgroup analysis, H. pylori infection and genotype analysis using PCR–RFLP methods increase the association between IL-1β-511 T allele carrier and risk of stomach cancer. A positive relationship was found between the IL-1β-511 C/T SNP and stomach carcinoma susceptibility, and the results suggest that Asian ethnicity, H. pylori infection and methodologically, PCR–RFLP genotyping strengthen this relationship. Reflecting on prevalence of H. pylori in Asian countries, additional studies on the IL-1β-511 C/T SNP in the context of ethnicity and H. pylori infection may provide key insights into the mechanism underlying gastric cancer carcinogenesis. It was found PCR–RFLP is the most reliable genotyping method, and thus, it is recommendable to adopt it to determine the presence of the IL-1β-511 C/T SNP."

3,"Cancer Mortality and Long-Term Environmental Exposure of Cadmium in Contaminated Community Based on a Third Retrospective Cause of Death Investigation of Residents Living in the Guangdong Province from 2004 to 2005. This study compared the temporal and geographic trends of cancer in China with a specific focus on the long-term exposure to soil cadmium (Cd) pollution. The geographic information system (GIS; kriging interpolation method) was used to detect the Cd contained in the soil from the Dabaoshan area, Guangdong Province. The standard rate ratio (SRR) was calculated to describe the relationship between Cd exposure and cancer mortality risk using the low-exposure group as a reference. Eight hundred six cancer deaths (533 male and 273 female) in the total population of 972,970 were identified, and the age-standardized rate (world) was 145.64 per 100,000. Significant dose-response relationships were found using the low-exposure group as the reference group. The Cd soil levels were positively associated with the cancer mortality risk in the community population, particularly for all cancers (SRR = 3.27; 95% CI = 2.42–4.55), esophageal cancer (SRR = 5.42; 95% CI = 1.07–30.56), stomach cancer (SRR = 5.99; 95% CI = 2.00–18.66), liver cancer (SRR = 4.45; 95% CI = 2.16–10.34), and lung cancer (SRR = 2.86; 95% CI = 1.62–5.31) for the total population. Additionally, similar results were obtained when using the 2000 China standard population. Cd exposure significantly affected the standardized mortality rates (China) by age group for all cancers, esophageal cancer, stomach cancer, liver cancer, and lung cancer in the total population, particularly in the age groups of 35–54, 55–74, and ≥ 75 years, respectively. Cd soil level is likely positively associated with increased cancer mortality of all cancer types and esophageal, stomach, liver, and lung cancers but not for other specific categories of cancer."
3,"Trends in oral cavity, pharyngeal, oesophageal and gastric cancer mortality rates in Spain, 1952–2006: an age-period-cohort analysis Although oral cavity, pharyngeal, oesophageal and gastric cancers share some risk factors, no comparative analysis of mortality rate trends in these illnesses has been undertaken in Spain. This study aimed to evaluate the independent effects of age, death period and birth cohort on the mortality rates of these tumours. Specific and age-adjusted mortality rates by tumour and sex were analysed. Age-period-cohort log-linear models were fitted separately for each tumour and sex, and segmented regression models were used to detect changes in period- and cohort-effect curvatures. Among men, the period-effect curvatures for oral cavity/pharyngeal and oesophageal cancers displayed a mortality trend that rose until 1995 and then declined. Among women, oral cavity/pharyngeal cancer mortality increased throughout the study period whereas oesophageal cancer mortality decreased after 1970. Stomach cancer mortality decreased in both sexes from 1965 onwards. Lastly, the cohort-effect curvature showed a certain degree of similarity for all three tumours in both sexes, which was greater among oral cavity, pharyngeal and oesophageal cancers, with a change point in evidence, after which risk of death increased in cohorts born from the 1910-1920s onwards and decreased among the 1950–1960 cohorts and successive generations. This latter feature was likewise observed for stomach cancer. While the similarities of the cohort effects in oral cavity/pharyngeal, oesophageal and gastric tumours support the implication of shared risk factors, the more marked changes in cohort-effect curvature for oral cavity/pharyngeal and oesophageal cancer could be due to the greater influence of some risk factors in their aetiology, such as smoking and alcohol consumption. The increase in oral cavity/pharyngeal cancer mortality in women deserves further study."
3,"Cancer Research in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: Consortiums, Implementation Science and Healthcare Delivery. Having caused over 8 million deaths worldwide in 2013, cancer is now the second leading cause of human death. 1 While cancer is often identified as a high-income country (HIC) health problem, low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) account for 57 % of cases and 65 % of cancer deaths globally. 2 The burden of cancer will continue to shift to less-developed countries due to the growth and aging of world populations, with increasing prevalence of known risk factors. 3 Looking ahead, the 12.7 million cases that occurred in 2008 are predicted to rise an additional 75 % to 22.2 million by 2030, the majority in LMICs. 4 Cancer demographics vary among countries but correlate with the level of economic development. 4 Cancers of the breast, lung, colorectum, and prostate account for half of the overall cancer burden in regions of the highest Human Development Index (HDI), while cancers of the esophagus, stomach, and liver are relatively more common in medium-HDI regions. Back in 1990, cervical cancer was more common than both breast and liver cancer in low-HDI regions but those trends are shifting. Cervical cancer prevention is improving as breast cancer rates continue to rise. 5 Overall, the rapid societal and economic transition in many countries means that any reductions in infection-related cancers (cervical, liver, stomach) are offset by an increasing number of new cases that are more associated with reproductive, dietary, and hormonal factors (breast, colorectal, prostate). 4 Global cancer consortiums (GCCs) can be defined as groups with a shared mission and common set of objectives that collaborate to advance some broad aspect of global"
3,"Clinical study to identify specific characteristics of cancer newly developed in the remnant stomach Cancer newly developed in the remnant stomach (CRS) after partial gastrectomy is worthy of attention not only because it is a typical model of carcinogenesis but also from the aspect of cancer diagnosis. We treated 47 patients with CRS in the 20 years from 1979 to 1998. Clinicopathological variables, as well as long-term survival results after the second surgery, were reviewed to clarify whether there were any differences in the characteristics of this disease entity compared with the usual primary gastric cancer. The mean time interval between the initial surgery and surgery for CRS was 25.8 years for patients with CRS with previous benign gastric lesions, and 10.6 years for those with previous gastric cancer. CRS was frequently detected at an early stage in the patients with previous cancer, and in the patients who had undergone reconstruction by the Billroth I method (regardless of the primary nature of the disease). Cancers with a differentiated histology developed more frequently in the patients who had undergone the initial surgery for cancer disease. Long-term survival results after the second surgery clearly demonstrated that surgical treatment for CRS was as effective as that for primary cancer in the upper stomach (PUC). In addition, it was confirmed that new lymphatic drainage into the lower mediastinum or the jejunal mesentery had developed after the initial gastric surgery. The findings suggested that patients with CRS and those with PUC should be treated similarly, although the findings of a high incidence of lymph node metastasis to the lower mediastinum and/or to the jejunal mesentery in the CRS patients should be taken into consideration."
3,"PHF2 histone demethylase acts as a tumor suppressor in association with p53 in cancer. Plant homeodomain finger 2 (PHF2) has a role in epigenetic regulation of gene expression by demethylating H3K9-Me2. Several genome-wide studies have demonstrated that the chromosomal region including the PHF2 gene is often deleted in some cancers including colorectal cancer, and this finding encouraged us to investigate the tumor suppressive role of PHF2. As p53 is a critical tumor suppressor in colon cancer, we tested the possibility that PHF2 is an epigenetic regulator of p53. PHF2 was associated with p53, and thereby, promoted p53-driven gene expression in cancer cells under genotoxic stress. PHF2 converted the chromatin that is favorable for transcription by demethylating the repressive H3K9-Me2 mark. In an HCT116 xenograft model, PHF2 was found to be required for the anticancer effects of oxaliplatin and doxorubicin. In PHF2-deficient xenografts, p53 expression was profoundly induced by both drugs, but its downstream product p21 was not, suggesting that p53 cannot be activated in the absence of PHF2. To find clinical evidence about the role of PHF2, we analyzed the expressions of PHF2, p53 and p21 in human colon cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues from patients. PHF2 was downregulated in cancer tissues and PHF2 correlated with p21 in cancers expressing functional p53. Colon and stomach cancer tissue arrays showed a positive correlation between PHF2 and p21 expressions. Informatics analyses using the Oncomine database also supported our notion that PHF2 is downregulated in colon and stomach cancers. On the basis of these findings, we propose that PHF2 acts as a tumor suppressor in association with p53 in cancer development and ensures p53-mediated cell death in response to chemotherapy."
3,"Cancer incidence among First Nations adults in Canada: follow-up of the 1991 Census Mortality Cohort (1992-2009) Estimate site-specific cancer incidence rates for a wide range of cancers in First Nations adults in Canada, and compare these with rates in non-Aboriginal adults. Responses from persons aged 25 and older to the 1991 Long Form Census were linked to national mortality and cancer databases. First Nations- and non-Aboriginal-specific incidence rates were age-standardized to the world standard population. The sex- and site-specific relative risks (RR) of cancer in First Nations compared to those in non-Aboriginal adults were estimated with Poisson regression. Results were stratified by residence on-reserve (all cancers combined) and region of Canada (four most common cancer sites). Compared to non-Aboriginal adults, First Nations had higher incidence of colon and rectum, kidney, cervix, and liver cancers and lower incidence of prostate, breast, bladder, uterus, ovary, and brain cancers, as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, and melanoma. First Nations women additionally had higher incidence of stomach, gallbladder, and laryngeal cancers and lower incidence of thyroid cancers compared to non-Aboriginal women. The higher relative incidence of stomach and gallbladder cancers was observed only among First Nations adults who reported living on-reserve. Incidence of lung cancer was similar for First Nations and non-Aboriginal adults nationally, though variation by region of Canada was observed. First Nations people in Canada have disproportionately high rates of certain cancers, providing evidence to support public health policy and programming. More research is needed to identify factors contributing to the significantly lower incidence observed for various cancer types. Novel methods for studying disparities in cancer incidence among First Nations people are required to support ongoing cancer control planning and advocacy."
3,"Expression of transforming growth factor beta-1 in gastric cancer and in the gastric mucosa of first-degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer. Transforming growth factors beta (TGF-β) constitute a family of polypeptide growth factors that control cell growth, cell differentiation and migration, as well as the formation of the extracellular matrix. Recent analyses revealed the overexpression of TGF-β1 in human gastric cancers and demonstrated increased cell proliferation in the stomach of patients with gastric cancer and their first-degree relatives. Using human gastric tissues obtained from patients with gastric cancer (n = 19), biopsies from healthy first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients (n = 18) and healthy individuals (n = 19), we analysed the expression of TGF-β1 using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry. Fifteen of 19 patients with gastric cancer expressed TGF-β1 in the tumour. In 11 of these 15 cases TGF-β1 mRNA was also detectable in the non-tumourous stomach. Interestingly, all but two individuals with a first-degree relative diagnosed with gastric cancer exhibited TGF-β1 expression in either the antrum or corpus biopsy or both. In contrast, only one of 19 individuals without a family history of gastric cancer expressed TGF-β1 in the stomach (P< 0.0001). TGF-β1 expression is detectable in a large proportion of gastric cancers and in the stomach of healthy first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients. Since individuals without gastric cancers in their family express TGF-β1 only in one of 19 cases, the induction of TGF-β1 expression in first-degree relatives of patients with gastric cancer points to the presence of specific molecular alterations in a subgroup of individuals with an increased risk of developing gastric cancer that may precede the development of gastric cancers. © 2000 Cancer Research Campaign"
3,"Phase 1a/1b and pharmacogenetic study of docetaxel, oxaliplatin and capecitabine in patients with advanced cancer of the stomach or the gastroesophageal junction The prognosis of gastroesophageal cancer is poor, and current regimens are associated with limited efficacy. The purpose of this study was to explore the safety and preliminary efficacy of docetaxel, oxaliplatin plus capecitabine for advanced cancer of the stomach or the gastroesophageal junction (GEJ). Secondary objectives included pharmacokinetic and pharmacogenetic analyses. Patients were treated in escalating dose levels with docetaxel and oxaliplatin (both on day 1), plus capecitabine b.i.d. on days 1–14 every 3 weeks, to determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose (MTD). An expansion cohort was treated at the MTD. A total of ten polymorphisms in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic candidate genes were analyzed and tested for association with treatment outcome. A total of 34 evaluable patients were enrolled. The MTD was docetaxel 50 mg/m2, oxaliplatin 100 mg/m2 plus capecitabine 850 mg/m2 b.i.d. The median number of treatment cycles was 6 (range 2–8). Grade ≥ 3 toxicities included neutropenia (24 %), leukocytopenia (15 %), febrile neutropenia (12 %), fatigue (9 %) and diarrhea (6 %). The overall response rate was 45 %; two patients achieved a complete response. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 6.5 months (95 % CI 5.4–7.6) and 11.0 months (95 % CI 7.9–14.1), respectively. The polymorphisms ERCC1 354C>T, TYMS 1053C>T and rs2612091 in ENOSF1 were associated with severe toxicity; ERCC1 354C>T and ERCC2 2251A>C were associated with poor progression-free survival. Docetaxel, oxaliplatin plus capecitabine are a well-tolerable, safe and effective treatment regimen for patients with advanced cancer of the stomach or GEJ. Pharmacogenetic markers in pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic candidate genes may be predictive for treatment outcome."

We compared the feasibility and safety of ESD for metachronous tumor found in the remnant stomach after distal gastrectomy with ESD for tumor in the upper third of the intact stomach. We retrospectively compared clinical outcome and safety of 13 lesions (11 early gastric cancers (EGCs) and 2 dysplasias) in the remnant stomach and 30 lesions (28 EGCs and 2 dysplasias) in the upper third of the intact stomach. All patients were treated with ESD at a cancer center hospital. En bloc resection rates were 100% (13/13) for remnant gastric tumor and 87% (26/30) for upper-third tumor (p = 0.30). En bloc resection rates with tumor-free margins (R0 resection) were 92% (12/13) for remnant gastric tumor and 73% (22/30) for upper-third tumor (p = 0.24). Curative resection rates were 85% (11/13) for remnant gastric tumor and 67% (20/30) for upper-third tumor (p = 0.29). Median procedure duration for ESD was 68 min (range 32–233 min) in the remnant stomach and 78 min (range 45–261 min) in the intact stomach (p = 0.49). One case of perforation and one of delayed bleeding occurred in the upper-third tumor group, whereas none occurred in the remnant tumor group. Local recurrence was found in no patients in the remnant gastric tumor group but in one patient in the upper-third tumor group. ESD for metachronous remnant gastric tumor was feasible and safe in comparison with ESD for tumor in the upper third of the intact stomach."
3,"Gene methylation profile of gastric cancerous tissue according to tumor site in the stomach. There is considerable information on the methylation of the promoter regions of different genes involved in gastric carcinogenesis. However, there is a lack of information on how this epigenetic process differs in tumors originating at different sites in the stomach. The aim of this study is to assess the methylation profiles of the MLH1, MGMT, and DAPK-1 genes in cancerous tissues from different stomach sites. Samples were acquired from 81 patients suffering stomach adenocarcinoma who underwent surgery for gastric cancer in the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Hospital Kaunas Clinics in 2009–2012. Gene methylation was investigated with methylation-specific PCR. The study was approved by the Lithuanian Biomedical Research Ethics Committee. The frequencies of methylation in cancerous tissues from the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the stomach were 11.1, 23.1, and 45.4 %, respectively, for MLH1; 22.2, 30.8, and 57.6 %, respectively, for MGMT; and 44.4, 48.7, and 51.5 %, respectively, for DAPK-1. MLH1 and MGMT methylation was observed more often in the lower third of the stomach than in the upper third (p < 0.05). In the middle third, DAPK-1 promoter methylation was related to more-advanced disease in the lymph nodes (N2–3 compared with N0–1 [p = 0.02]) and advanced tumor stage (stage III rather than stages I–II [p = 0.05]). MLH1 and MGMT methylation correlated inversely when the tumor was located in the lower third of the stomach (coefficient, –0.48; p = 0.01). DAPK-1 and MLH1 methylation correlated inversely in tumors in the middle-third of the stomach (coefficient, –0.41; p = 0.01). Gene promoter methylation depends on the gastric tumor location."
3,"Time trends in socioeconomic differences in incidence rates of cancers of gastro-intestinal tract in Finland The magnitude of socioeconomic differences in health varies between societies, and over time within a given society. We studied the association between social class and incidence of cancers of the gastro-intestinal tract over time in a large cohort in Finland. We studied social class variation among 45–69 year-old Finns during 1971–95 in incidence of cancers of the gastro-intestinal tract by means of a computerized record linkage of the Finnish Cancer Registry and the 1970 Population Census, which included social class data. There were 2.3 million individuals in the cohort under follow-up, with 1622 cases of cancer of the esophagus, 8069 stomach (non-cardia), 1116 cardia, 408 small intestine, 6361 colon, 5274 rectum, 1616 liver, 1756 gallbladder, and 5084 pancreas during 1971–1995. Cancers of the esophagus, stomach, cardia, gallbladder and pancreas were most common among persons belonging to a low social class. Cancers of the small intestine in males only, colon in both genders, and rectum in females were most common in the higher social classes. Incidence of stomach cancer decreased and incidence of colon cancer increased over time in both genders in all social classes, and the large differences between social classes remained unchanged over time. Incidence rates of cardia cancer did not change substantially over time. There is a large variation in incidence of cancer of the gastrointestinal tract by social class in Finland. Although much of the observed social class differences probably could be explained by known etiological factors such as diet, physical exercise, alcohol consumption, smoking and exogenous hormone use, part of the variation is apparently attributable to largely unknown factors."
3,"A novel tumor-associated mucin of gastrointestinal carcinoma. Purpose: To identify a new tumor-associated antigen, a monoclonal antibody, SC142, was produced by immunizing mice with a stomach cancer cell line. The tumor specificity of mAb SC142 was studied by immunohistochemical staining, and the biochemical characteristics of this new gastrointestinal tumor-associated antigen were also studied. Methods: The expression of SC142-reactive antigen was investigated in various cancers by immunohistochemical staining. The SC142-reactive antigen was characterized by immunoblotting, sodium metaperiodate treatment assay, O-glycanase digestion assay, and lectin binding assay. Results: The SC142-reactive antigen was highly expressed in 78% of gastric cancers (29/37) and 87% of colon cancers (27/31). No normal colon or stomach tissues remote from the tumor were positive for the antigen. The antibody also reacted with other tumors of epithelial origin such as lung squamous cell cancer (2/4), breast ductal cancer (2/20), bladder transitional cell carcinoma (4/6), and uterine cancer (3/16). Western blot analysis of the antigen revealed glycoprotein(s) which migrated as a smear ranging from the origin of the gel to about the 80 kDa region. The reactivity of this antigen with SC142 was reduced by sodium metaperiodate treatment or O-glycanase digestion, but not by N-glycanase, suggesting that the epitope is an O-glycan. In lectin-binding assay, this antigen reacted only with wheat germ agglutinin but not with Ricinus communis agglutinin, Datura stramonium agglutinin, and Sambucus nigra agglutinin. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the antigen defined by SC142 is a tumor-associated antigen that could differentiate the gastrointestinal cancer cells from the normal cells. Therefore, SC142 may become a valuable tool for the immunohistochemical diagnosis and tumor immunoscintigraphy of the gastrointestinal cancer patients."
3,"Incidence Trend of Gastrointestinal Cancer in Markazi, in the Center of Iran, Population-Based Cancer Registry Results: 2010-2014. Gastrointestinal cancers are considered as the most common type of cancer among men and the second most common cancer in women after breast cancer in Iran. This study was performed to investigate the epidemiology of gastrointestinal cancer in Markazi Province. This is an epidemiological study in which data was gathered from the population-based cancer registry program in the Markazi province of Iran during the years 2010–2014. Data were recorded in Excel software and coded based on ICD-O. All cases out of Markazi provinces were excluded from study, and cases with code C-15-C20 were included in this study. Stata 11 was used to analyze the data. In this study, 2975 new cases of gastrointestinal cancer in Markazi province were included in the analysis. The highest number of cancers was stomach (with 1595 cases), followed by colorectal cancer (980 cases), esophageal cancer (318 cases), and finally small bowl cancer (82 cases). The mean age of gastro-intestinal cancer diagnosis was 65.07 years. The results showed that with increasing age, the incidence of gastro-intestinal cancers increased, and in all sites and both sexes, the highest incidence of gastro-intestinal cancer was in the age group above 70 years. In both sexes, the age specific rate of stomach cancer was higher than other sites (with highest incidence in 2013) followed by colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, and small bowl cancer. The results showed similar incidence rate of gastrointestinal cancer in Markazi province to other provinces in Iran. This study found that stomach cancer is the most common cancer in the Markazi province; therefore, identifying effective and preventing factors is necessary."

3,"Sentinel lymph node mapping of the colon and stomach using lymphoseek in a pig model. Background: Lymphoseek is a radiopharmaceutical designed for sentinel lymph node (SLN) mapping. The purpose of this study was to compare Lymphoseek colon and gastric pharmacokinetics with filtered [99mTc]sulfur colloid (fTcSC). Methods: Eight anesthetized pigs received an endoscopic injection of Lymphoseek or fTcSC in the stomach and colon. Scintigraphy was obtained of both administration sites at 15-minute intervals up to 3 hours after injection, after which all SLNs were identified by a handheld gamma probe through a laparotomy incision. Isosulfan blue was administered at the injection site 5 minutes before SLN mapping. The percentage of injected dose (%ID) was measured for all harvested nodes, and the clearance half-life (T;  c) was calculated for all injection sites. Results: The mean Lymphoseek clearance for colon (T;  c, 2.56 ± 1.04 hours) and gastric (T;  c, 3.83 ± 1.18 hours) injection sites was statistically faster (P = .030) compared with fTcSC (colon T;  c, 14.98 ± 3.41 hours; stomach T;  c, 14.52 ± 4.08 hours). After 3 hours, Lymphoseek exhibited a mean SLN %ID of 1.32% ± 1.71% in the colon and 2.04% ± 2.12% in the stomach; this was not statistically different from fTcSC (colon, .63% ± .39%; stomach, 2.35% ± 2.90%). SLN uptake of Lymphoseek was significantly different from second-echelon node %ID for the colon (P = .011) and gastric (P = .029) injection sites. All SLNs exceeded 10 times background, and there was no discordance between isosulfan blue and Lymphoseek or fTcSC. Conclusions: Three hours after colon stomach administration, Lymphoseek demonstrated rapid injection site clearance, detectable SLN uptake, and low second-echelon node uptake."
3,"Feasibility of esophageal reconstruction using a pedicled jejunum with intrathoracic esophagojejunostomy in the upper mediastinum for esophageal cancer. An alternative conduit is needed when the gastric tube cannot be used as an esophageal substitute for reconstruction after esophagectomy. We adopted pedicle jejunal reconstruction with intrathoracic anastomosis in the upper mediastinum under such circumstances. The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of this technique. Two hundred and ten patients with esophageal cancer underwent esophagectomy and reconstruction from 1998 to 2013. Among them, 6 patients underwent colon interposition (colon group) and 13 underwent jejunum reconstruction (jejunum group) including 8 thoracoscopic anastomosis. The operative results of both groups were compared with those of 191 gastric tube reconstructions (stomach group). The operative times in the colon and jejunum groups were significantly longer than that in the stomach group (P = 0.001 and P = 0.018, respectively). The colon group showed more operative blood loss and more frequent anastomotic leakage and ischemic stenosis of the conduit than did the stomach group (1605 vs. 530 g, P = 0.007; 50 vs. 12.6 %, P = 0.035; 16.7 vs. 0 %, P = 0.03, respectively). There was no anastomotic leakage, conduit necrosis and mortality in the jejunum group. Ischemic stenosis of the conduit occurred more frequently in jejunum group than in the stomach group (23.1 vs. 0 %, P < 0.001). However, the stenosis could be managed safely with endoscopic treatment. Patient survival in the colon and jejunum groups was consistent with that in the stomach group. Pedicle jejunal reconstruction with intrathoracic anastomosis can be performed safely under thoracotomy or thoracoscopic surgery when stomach cannot be used as an esophageal substitute after esophagectomy."
3,"NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) C609T polymorphism and the risk of eight cancers for Japanese. Methods. The cases were 102 patients with esophageal cancer, 143 with stomach cancer, 74 with colon cancer, 72 with rectal cancer, 192 with lung cancer, 237 with breast cancer, 56 with prostate cancer, and 108 with malignant lymphoma. Controls consisted of outpatients from two sources: 241 noncancer outpatients who underwent gastroscopy and 399 first-visit outpatients, expected to include about 20% with cancer. Genotyping was conducted by polymerase chain reaction with confronting two-pair primers (PCR-CTPP). ; Results. The TT genotype with null enzyme activity was found in 19.9% of the 241 noncancer gastroscopy examinees, 16.5% of the 399 first-visit outpatients, 12.7% of the esophageal cancer patients, 16.8% of the stomach cancer patients, 13.5% of the colon cancer patients, 9.7% of the rectal cancer patients, 17.7% of the lung cancer patients, 14.3% of the breast cancer patients, 16.1% of the prostate cancer patients, and 15.7% of the malignant lymphoma patients. The odds ratios (ORs) of the genotypes were not significant for any cancers combined or for any site of cancer, except for lung cancer (OR, 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46–0.96 for CT relative to CC). The OR of current smoking for cancers of the esophagus and lung combined was different between the CC genotype (OR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.06–3.98) and TT genotype (OR, 5.11; 95% CI, 1.37–19.05), although the difference was not significant. ; Conclusion. This study suggests that the CC genotype of the NQO1 C609T polymorphism is associated with the risk of lung cancer, and that the TT genotype increases the risk of smoking for cancers of the esophagus and lung."
3,"Endocrine carcinoma of the stomach: clinicopathological analysis of 27 surgically treated cases in a single institute. Gastric endocrine carcinoma (EC) is an uncommon tumor of the stomach and the clinical features are not well known. Additionally, the classification and staging systems of this tumor are not yet unified worldwide. In this study, we reviewed 27 patients with gastric EC to evaluate the clinicopathological characteristics of this tumor. We retrospectively reviewed 27 patients with gastric EC among 6466 patients who had undergone gastrectomy between 1986 and 2008 at our institute. Clinicopathological features including immunohistochemistry of Ki-67 were investigated to evaluate the malignant potential of the tumor. Furthermore, survivals were compared between the 7th edition of the International Union Against Cancer (UICC)-TNM (7th TNM) classification for gastric cancer (GC) and the new TNM classification for foregut neuroendocrine tumors (NET). The median survival of the patients was 19.0 months. The 5-year survival rate was 100% in pathological stage (pStage) I, 40% in pStage II, 38% in pStage III, and 11% in pStage IV according to the 7th TNM classification for GC. Survivals by stage showed great difference between the 7th TNM classification for GC and the new TNM classification for foregut NET, but each system correlated with survival. The Ki-67 labeling index was more than 20% in most of the patients. Univariate analysis revealed that maximum tumor diameter, tumor depth, lymph node metastasis, lymphatic invasion, pStage, and curability had significant correlations with survival. Early detection and curative operations are essential for improving the prognosis of gastric EC. However, some adjuvant chemotherapies are required for advanced-stage tumors. Classification and staging systems may need to be unified worldwide for further analysis."
3,"Evaluation of rs10811661 polymorphism in CDKN2A / B in colon and gastric cancer. One of the causes of colon and gastric cancer is the dysregulation of carcinogenic genes, tumor inhibitors, and micro-RNA. The purpose of this study is to apply rs10811661 polymorphism in CDKN2A /B gene as an effective biomarker of colon cancer and early detection of gastric cancer. As a result,400 blood samples, inclusive of 200 samples from healthy individuals and 200 samples (100 samples from intestinal cancer,100 samples from stomach cancer) from the blood of someone with these cancers, to determine the genotype of genes in healthful and ill people through PCR-RFLP approach and Allelic and genotypic tests of SPSS software. To observe the connection between gastric cancer and bowel cancer risk and genotypes, the t-student test for quantitative variables and Pearson distribution for qualitative variables have been tested and the results have been evaluated using the Chi-square test. The effects confirmed that the highest frequency of TT genotypes is in affected individuals and CC genotype is in healthful individuals. In addition, it confirmed that women were more inclined than men to T3 tumor invasion and most grade II and III colon cancers, and in older sufferers with gastric cancer, the grade of tumor tended to be grade I. Among genetic variety and rs10811661, with invasiveness, there is a tumor size and degree in the affected person. In summary, our findings suggest that the rs10811661 polymorphism of the CDKN2A / B gene is strongly associated with the occurrence of intestinal cancer and stomach is linked to its potential role as a prognostic biomarker for the management of bowel cancer and stomach."
3,"Cell-free ascites from ovarian cancer patients induces Warburg metabolism and cell proliferation through TGFβ-ERK signaling. Ascites plays a key role in supporting the metastatic potential of ovarian cancer cells. Shear stress and carry-over of cancer cells by ascites flow support carcinogenesis and metastasis formation. In addition, soluble factors may participate in the procarcinogenic effects of ascites in ovarian cancer. This study aimed to determine the biological effects of cell-free ascites on carcinogenesis in ovarian cancer cells. Cell-free ascites from ovarian cancer patients (ASC) non-selectively induced cell proliferation in multiple models of ovarian cancer and untransformed primary human dermal fibroblasts. Furthermore, ASC induced a Warburg-type rearrangement of cellular metabolism in A2780 ovarian cancer cells characterized by increases in cellular oxygen consumption and glycolytic flux; increases in glycolytic flux were dominant. ASC induced mitochondrial uncoupling and fundamentally reduced fatty acid oxidation. Ascites-elicited effects were uniform among ascites specimens. ASC-elicited transcriptomic changes in A2780 ovarian cancer cells included induction of the TGFβ-ERK/MEK pathway, which plays a key role in inducing cell proliferation and oncometabolism. ASC-induced gene expression changes, as well as the overexpression of members of the TGFβ signaling system, were associated with poor survival in ovarian cancer patients. We provided evidence that the activation of the autocrine/paracrine of TGFβ signaling system may be present in bladder urothelial carcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma. Database analysis suggests that the TGFβ system may feed forward bladder urothelial carcinoma and stomach adenocarcinoma. Soluble components of ASC support the progression of ovarian cancer. These results suggest that reducing ascites production may play an essential role in the treatment of ovarian cancer by inhibiting the progression and reducing the severity of the disease."
3,"Estrogen receptor β is expressed in human stomach adenocarcinoma Purpose. In stomach adenocarcinoma, the role of the hormonal receptor, estrogen receptor (ER), has been controversial. Recently, a new estrogen receptor, called estrogen receptor β (ERβ), was found to be expressed in various tissues including normal gastrointestinal tract. In this paper, the expression of ERβ in stomach adenocarcinomas has been investigated for the first time, specifically in signet ring cell adenocarcinomas, together with surrounding non-cancerous tissues. Methods. By immunohistochemistry the expression of ERα and β was studied in 29 stomach adenocarcinomas, ten signet ring cell adenocarcinomas, and 19 other adenocarcinomas. Western blotting was performed to examine the immunohistochemical result. Statistical studies (Student's t test and χ2-test) explored the relation between the immunohistochemical result and clinicopathological characteristics. Results. All 29 adenocarcinomas, including the signet ring cell ones, demonstrated clear ERβ nucleus staining. Lymphocytes, venous endothelial cells, smooth muscle, and non-cancerous stomach glands also showed strong ERβ staining, while no staining was observed in the immunohistochemistry of ERα. Western blotting showed equivalent ERβ protein levels in cancerous and non-cancerous tissues, which was consistent with the results of immunohistochemical staining. Among signet ring cell adenocarcinomas of the stomach, cytoplasm were stained in addition to nuclei, specifically in patients under the age of 40 years. Conclusions. Our results imply that the effects of estrogen in stomach cancer, as well as those in normal stomach, may be mediated by ERβ, and that the role of ERβ may differ by the subtype of stomach adenocarcinoma – specifically signet ring cell adenocarcinomas and other ones – although large scale samples are needed to confirm these findings."
3,"Cancer incidence near municipal solid waste incinerators in Great Britain. By use of the postcoded database held by the Small Area Health Statistic Unit, cancer incidence of over 14 million people living near 72 municipal solid waste incinerators in Great Britain was examined from 1974-86 (England), 1974-84 (Wales) and 1975-87 (Scotland). Numbers of observed cases were compared with expected numbers calculated from national rates (regionally adjusted) after stratification by a deprivation index based on 1981 census small area statistics. Observed-expected ratios were tested for decline in risk with distance up to 7.5 km. The study was conducted in two stages: the first involved a stratified random sample of 20 incinerators; the second the remaining 52 incinerators. Over the two stages of the study was a statistically significant (P<0.05) decline in risk with distance from incinerators for all cancers combined, stomach, colorectal, liver and lung cancer. Among these cancers in the second stage, the excess from 0 to 1 km ranged from 37% for liver cancer (0.95) excess cases 10(-5) per year to 5% for colorectal cancer. There was evidence of residual confounding near the incinerators, which seems to be a likely explanation of the finding for all cancers, stomach and lung, and also to explain at least part of the excess of liver cancer. For this reason and because of a substantial level of misdiagnosis (mainly secondary tumours) found among registrations and death certificates for liver cancer, further investigation, including histological review of the cases, is to be done to help determine whether or not there is an increase in primary liver cancer in the vicinity of incinerators."
3,"Dietary risk factors in intestinal and diffuse types of stomach cancer: a multicenter case-control study in Poland. A hospital-based, multicenter, case-control study has been performed in Poland covering 741 incident stomach-cancer cases (520 males and 221 females) and the same number of controls. All stomach-cancer diagnoses were evaluated for histologic type according to the Lauren criteria. Fifty-one percent were of the intestinal type, 35 percent of the diffuse type, and 8.5 percent of the mixed type. The frequency of consumption of individual food items and several food groups was analyzed and the association of various foods with stomach cancer risk was evaluated after controlling for sex, age, occupation, education, and residency. Increased consumption of sausages was related significantly to gastric cancer risk, whereas increased consumption of cheese products, nonwhite bread, vegetables, and fruit was associated with decreased risk. A particularly strong decrease in risk was associated with consumption of radishes and onions. When consumption of fruits and vegetables, sausages, nonwhite bread, and cheese were introduced simultaneously in a multivariate model, independent effects were found only for fruit and vegetables, sausages, and nonwhite bread. The use of table salt, the frequency of eating hot meals, and an irregular eating pattern were also associated with increased risk, while additional consumption of fruit between meals showed reduced risk. If a reduction in vegetable and fruit consumption took place after marriage, an increased risk for stomach cancer was found, whereas augmented consumption of these food items after marriage decreased the risk. Separate risk models were calculated for stomach cancer of the intestinal and diffuse types, but both histologic varieties showed the same pattern of associations with dietary risk factors."
3,"Meeting report of the 73rd Japanese gastric cancer congress. surgical techniques. In this session, reconstruction methods after gastrectomy were discussed. K. Nakamura, Tokai University, evaluated the survival rates in patients who had undergone various reconstructive procedures after distal and total gastrectomy. They reported that higher 5-year survival rates were observed in patients who had undergone gastroduodenostomy and jejunal interposition, allowing food to pass through the duodenum, than in those who had undergone gastro-or esophagojejunostomy. They suggested that reconstruction enabling food to pass through the duodenum should be performed irrespective of the disease stage. Y. Nakane, Kansai Medical University, reported that reconstruction with a jejunal pouch after total gastrectomy was effective in the prevention of the small stomach syndrome, but that long-term emptying disorders were observed in some patients after Roux-en-Y anastomosis with a jejunal pouch. H. Kashimura, Jikei University, reported that the ileocolon interposition was superior to the Roux-en-Y method after total gastrectomy because less reflux esophagitis and more food intake occurred at each meal. K. Yamaguchi, Sapporo Medical University, evaluated jejunal pouch interposition after proximal gastrectomy both clinically and experimentally. They performed jejunal pouch interposition or esophagogastrostomy in beagles and showed that the former was superior to the latter in terms of changes in gastrointestinal hormones, maintenance of body weight, and emptying of the residual stomach. They concluded that jejunal pouch interposition should be considered after proximal gastrectomy. S. Kinami, Kanazawa University, evaluated jejunal pouch interposition after distal gastrectomy. As compared with the Billroth I method, the incidences of dumping syndrome, bile reflux and inflammation of the remnant stomach, and Helicobacter pylori infection were all low."
3,"Prognostic factors in gastric cancer survivors comparing Cox proportional hazards and machine learning using a Korean National cohort. Background As the prognosis of gastric cancer has improved, the exploration of prognostic factors has become increasingly important. This study aimed to identify prognostic factors of gastric cancer using machine learning and statistical methods and to compare the effectiveness of different methodologies in identifying prognostic factors. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of cancer research data from survivors of gastric cancer in Korea. Patients were followed up from the date of curative treatment of gastric cancer to the date of recurrence, cancer-specific death, or censoring. The Cox proportional hazards, random survival forest, XGBoost, and DeepSurv models were used to calculate the risk of recurrence and cancer-specific death. All the models were trained on 80% of the training set, and the concordance index was used for comparison with 20% of the test set. The SHAP value was used for variable interpretation in the machine learning models. Results A total of 11,029 gastric cancer survivors with a median follow-up time of 6.19 years were included. Remnant stomach after gastric cancer treatment, T stage and N stage were the most important features for recurrence and mortality according to both the Cox model and the machine learning model. All the models had a concordance index greater than 0.7 without large differences. Conclusions The machine learning model is not inferior to conventional statistical analysis models and offers greater flexibility, especially when statistical assumptions are violated. The key prognostic factors identified through this approach include residual stomach after treatment and cancer stage.

3,"Genetic variation at 8q24, family history of cancer, and upper gastrointestinal cancers in a Chinese population Genetic variation at 8q24 is associated with prostate, bladder, breast, colorectal, thyroid, lung, ovarian, UADT, liver and stomach cancers. However, a role for variation at 8q24 in familial clustering of upper gastrointestinal cancers has not been studied. In order to explore potential inherited susceptibility, we analyzed epidemiologic data from a population-based case-control study of upper gastrointestinal cancers from Taixing, China. The study population includes 204 liver, 206 stomach, and 218 esophageal cancer cases and 415 controls. Associations between 8q24 rs1447295, rs16901979, rs6983267 and these cancers were stratified by family history of cancer. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were adjusted for potential confounders: age, sex, education, tobacco smoking, alcohol consumption, and BMI at interview. We also adjusted for hepatitis B and aflatoxin (liver cancer) and Helicobacter pylori (stomach cancer). In a dominant model, among those with a family history of cancer, rs1447295 was positively associated with liver cancer (OR(adj) 2.80; 95% CI 1.15-6.80). Heterogeneity was observed (P(heterogeneity) = 0.029) with rs6983267 and liver cancer, with positive association in the dominant model among those with a family history of cancer and positive association in the recessive model among those without a family history of cancer. When considered in a genetic risk score model, each additional 8q24 risk genotype increased the odds of liver cancer by two-fold among those with a family history of cancer (OR(adj) 2.00; 95% CI 1.15-3.47). These findings suggest that inherited susceptibility to liver cancer may exist in the Taixing population and that variation at 8q24 might be a genetic component of that inherited susceptibility."
3,"A leathery lining. A 44-year-old previously healthy man from Mexico presented with 10 days of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The exam was remarkable for decreased left-sided breath sounds, diffuse abdominal tenderness, and mild abdominal distention. Chest radiograph showed a large left pleural effusion. Computed tomography of the abdomen demonstrated a markedly thickened stomach wall, loculated peritoneal fluid collections, paraaortic lymphadenopathy, and omental carcinomatosis (Fig. 1). Thoracentesis was performed and cytopathological examination of the pleural fluid showed a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of upper gastrointestinal origin.

Given the extent of his tumor burden, the patient was treated with symptomatic management and transitioned to home hospice."
3,"Gastric phenotype signet-ring cell carcinoma of the stomach with multiple bone metastases effectively treated with sequential methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil. A 63-year-old woman presented with an abnormal serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis and radioisotope (RI) examination led to a strong suspicion of systemic bone metastatic tumors, although the origin was not known. Biopsies from bone metastatic lesions in the left ilium were performed under CT scan, and signet-ring cell carcinoma cells were detected pathologically. Also, a 0-IIc-like lesion was observed endoscopically in the stomach, and signet-ring cell carcinoma cells were also detected histologically. The patient’s platelet (Plt) levels were reduced and slight bleeding from the gingiva was detected when she brushed her teeth. Both the stomach and the bone metastatic lesions exhibited a gastric phenotype (G type) phenotypically. From these findings, we diagnosed the patient as having advanced (inoperable) stomach cancer with multiple bone metastases; she also exhibited disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). We treated her with sequential methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (sequential MTX/5-FU) therapy after obtaining her informed consent. After six cycles of the chemotherapy, the abnormal ALP and Plt levels were alleviated. At present, she is receiving weekly sequential MTX/5-FU therapy at the outpatient oncology unit; she has been receiving the therapy for about 7 months since the detection of the bone metastases and has had a total of 17 cycles. In conclusion, sequential MTX/5-FU therapy was effective for a patient with G-type signet-ring cell carcinoma of the stomach with bone metastases, suggesting that the phenotypic classification may be one of the useful markers for prediction of the effectiveness of chemotherapy in patients with inoperable advanced stomach cancer."
3,"Colonoscopy Insertion in Patients with Gastrectomy: Does Position Impact Cecal Intubation Time? <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">A history of abdominal surgery is associated with difficulty in colonoscopy insertion.

3,"Distinct methylation patterns of two APC gene promoters in normal and cancerous gastric epithelia. The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor suppressor gene is mutationally inactivated in both familial and sporadic forms of colorectal cancers. In addition, hypermethylation of CpG islands in the upstream portion of APC, a potential alternative mechanism of tumor suppressor gene inactivation, has been described in colorectal cancer. Because a subset of both gastric and colorectal cancers display the CpG island methylator phenotype, we hypothesized that epigenetic inactivation of APC was likely to occur in at least some gastric cancers. APC exhibits two forms of transcripts from exons 1A and 1B in the stomach. Therefore, we investigated CpG island methylation in the sequences upstream of exons 1A and 1B, i.e., promoters 1A and 1B, respectively. We evaluated DNAs from 10 gastric cancer cell lines, 40 primary gastric cancers, and 40 matching non-cancerous gastric mucosae. Methylated alleles of promoter 1A were present in 10 (100%) of 10 gastric cancer cell lines, 33 (82.5%) of 40 primary gastric cancers, and 39 (97.5%) of 40 noncancerous gastric mucosae. In contrast, promoter 1B was unmethylated in all of these same samples. APC transcripts from exon 1A were not expressed in nine of the 10 methylated gastric cancer cell lines, whereas APC transcripts were expressed from exon 1B. Thus, expression from a given promoter correlated well with its methylation status. We conclude that in contrast to the colon, methylation of promoter 1A is a normal event in the stomach; moreover, promoter 1B is protected from methylation in the stomach and thus probably does not participate in this form of epigenetic APC inactivation."
3,"Eradication of Helicobacter pylori for primary gastric cancer and secondary gastric cancer after endoscopic mucosal resection Because most gastric cancers develop from a background of Helicobacter pylori-infected gastric mucosa, H. pylori plays an important role in gastric carcinogenesis. Therefore, eradication of H. pylori may inhibit the incidence of gastric cancers. In experimental studies, H. pylori eradication has proved to act as a prophylaxis against gastric cancer. However, the results of recent randomized controlled studies are absolutely contradictory. In Japan, mucosal gastric cancer is usually resected by endoscopic treatment. As only a small part of the gastric mucosa is resected, secondary gastric cancer after endoscopic resection of the primary gastric cancer often develops at another site in the stomach. A nonrandomized Japanese study involving 132 early gastric cancer patients reported that eradication of H. pylori after endoscopic resection tended to reduce the development of secondary gastric cancer. Also, a retrospective multicenter survey indicated that the incidence rate of secondary gastric cancer in H. pylori-eradicated patients was about one-third that among patients in the noneradication group. We conducted a large-scale multicenter randomized trial to confirm the effect of H. pylori eradication on secondary and residual gastric cancer after endoscopic resection. This study was begun in 2003 and is ongoing at present. Diagnosis of a new carcinoma at another site of the stomach is defined as the primary end point, and recurrence of tumors at the resection site as a secondary end point. A total of 542 subjects have been enrolled in the study. This study will have the statistical power to demonstrate whether H. pylori eradication decreases the incidence and recurrence of gastric cancer."
3,"Distribution and photodynamic effects of meso-tetrahydroxyphenylchlorin (mTHPC) in the pancreas and adjacent tissues in the Syrian golden hamster Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has the potential to destroy small tumours with safe healing of adjacent normal tissue. This study looks at the effects of PDT on the normal pancreas and adjacent tissues in hamsters using the photosensitiser meso-tetrahydroxyphenylchlorin (mTHPC). Pharmacokinetic studies used fluorescence microscopy on sections of pancreas, stomach and duodenum 1 h to 6 days after mTHPC. Highest levels of sensitiser were seen in the gastric and duodenal mucosa and in the acinar pancreas after 2-4 days. For PDT, light at 652 nm was delivered by placing a 0.2 mm diameter bare-ended fibre against the tissue. An energy of 50 J was used 2 or 4 days after 0.1 or 0.3 mg kg-1 mTHPC and animals killed 1 to 7 days later. Maximum necrosis was seen 3 days after PDT with lesions up to 4 mm in pancreas, 4.5 mm in duodenum and 2.5 mm in stomach. By fractionating the light dose, the lesion size could be increased by 30%. The main complication was free or sealed duodenal perforation (avoided by shielding the duodenum). Partial, reversible bile duct obstruction was seen occasionally. There was no macroscopic damage to the bile ducts or major blood vessels. Apart from the duodenum, all lesions healed safely. In this animal model, only the duodenum was at risk of serious, irreversible damage. Treatment is likely to be safer in the much thicker human duodenum. mTHPC is a powerful photosensitiser and suitable for further study for tumours in the region of the pancreas although care is required near the duodenum."
3,"Unraveling the link between language barriers and cancer risk. <AbstractText Label=""PURPOSE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">Clear patient communication with the physician is an integral aspect of cancer treatment and successful health outcomes.

States such as California, New York, Texas, and New Jersey show high language isolate prevalence and elevated cancer incidence rates. Cancer subtype incidence rates varied between states, indicating the multifactorial importance of lifestyle, genetics, and environment in cancer. California had the highest language isolation ranking of 8.5% and elevated rates of ovarian (10.4/100,000) and stomach (9.1/100,000) cancers. New York, with the second-highest language isolation ranking of 7.6%, manifests a pronounced prevalence of ovarian (11.3/100,000) and stomach (10.9/100,000) cancers.

3,"Effects of initial disease status on lymph flow following gastrectomy in cases of carcinoma in the remnant stomach. In cases of carcinoma in the remnant stomach (CRS), the lymphatic flow may be altered by the initial surgery. In this study of CRS after gastrectomy, we investigated how the regions of lymph node metastasis and changes in lymphatic flow depend on initial disease status. The study included 76 patients with CRS who underwent gastrectomy between September 2002 and November 2014. We analyzed and compared the clinicopathological factors and survival periods between patients after distal gastrectomy for malignant disease (group M, 33 patients) and patients after distal gastrectomy for benign disease (group B, 43 patients). The depth of tumor invasion was more advanced in group B (T1/T2/T3/T4: group M 18/1/7/7, group B 8/11/8/16; P = 0.002). However, the degree of lymph node metastasis did not differ significantly between the two groups. The incidence of lymph node metastasis was high at stations 2 (19 %), 4sa (17 %), 10 (25 %), 11p (19 %), and 11d (27 %) in group M and 1 (14 %), 3 (23 %), and 4sb (15 %), and the mesojejunal lymph node (21 %) in group B. Lymph node dissection was highly beneficial at station 3, station 7, and the mesojejunum in both groups, but not at stations 10 or 11d. As compared with group B, group M showed higher incidences of lymph node metastasis in the greater curvature, splenic hilum, and lymph nodes along the splenic artery, suggesting the predominance of lymphatic flows from the greater curvature to the splenic hilum and from the remnant stomach to the splenic artery."
3,"Tumour-promotion by lime oil in the mouse forestomach. IN a recent communication1 it was shown that four different citrus oils promoted tumour development in mouse skin after pretreatment with a sub-carcinogenic dose of 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene (DMBA). Since man is continuously exposed to these oils in his food, it was decided to test one of them, lime oil, both for carcinogenicity and for tumour-promoting activity in the gastro-intestinal tract of mice. Another reason was the hope of demonstrating the two-stage mechanism of carcinogenesis in the alimentary canal. Previous attempts to do this have given inconclusive results2,3. In the most recent of these, Berenblum and Haran gave mice a single dose of one of four polycyclic hydrocarbons followed by 3 per cent croton oil weekly for 30 weeks. All treatments were given by stomach tube, and polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG) was the solvent throughout. The appropriate control groups were included. Numerous tumours of the fore-stomach developed in all their groups, both test and control. It was not stated whether the rest of the intestinal tract was examined. No evidence for tumour-promotion by croton oil was obtained. There are three possible reasons for this: (1) The doses of the hydrocarbons used were too high. Bock and King4 have since shown that the mouse forestomach is more sensitive than the skin to carcinogenic hydrocarbons. (2) Croton oil, in the concentration used, was carcinogenic. (3) PEG, although a suitable solvent for a single dose of a hydrocarbon5, reduces the tumour yield when given repeatedly after such a dose6 and is not, therefore, a suitable solvent for tumour-promoting substances."
3,"A novel method of intracorporeal end-to-end gastrogastrostomy in laparoscopic pylorus-preserving gastrectomy for early gastric cancer, including a unique anastomotic technique: piercing the stomach with a linear stapler. Delta-shaped anastomosis is usually applied for an intracorporeal gastrogastrostomy in totally laparoscopic pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (TLPPG). However, the remnant stomach is slightly twisted around the anastomosis because it connects in side-to-side fashion. To realize an intracorporeal end-to-end gastrogastrostomy using an endoscopic linear stapler, we invented a novel method including a unique anastomotic technique. In this new approach, we first made small gastrotomies at the greater and lesser curvatures of the transected antrum and then pierced it using an endoscopic linear stapler. After the pierced antrum and the proximal remnant stomach were mechanically connected, the gastrotomies and stapling lines were transected using an endoscopic linear stapler, creating an intracorporeal end-to-end gastrogastrostomy. We have named this technique the “piercing method” because piercing the stomach is essential to its implementation. Between October 2015 and June 2017, 26 patients who had clinically early gastric cancer at the middle third of the stomach without clinical evidence of lymph node metastasis underwent TLPPG involving the novel method. The 26 patients successfully underwent an intracorporeal mechanical end-to-end gastrogastrostomy by the piercing method. The median operation time of the 26 patients was 272 min (range 209–357 min). With the exception of one gastric stasis, no problems associated with the piercing method were encountered during and after surgery. The piercing method can safely create an intracorporeal mechanical end-to-end gastrogastrostomy in TLPPG. Piercing the stomach using an endoscopic linear stapler is a new technique for gastrointestinal anastomosis. This method should be considered if the surgical aim is creation of an intracorporeal end-to-end gastrogastrostomy in TLPPG."
3,"Stoichiogenomics reveal oxygen usage bias, key proteins and pathways associated with stomach cancer. Stomach cancer involves hypoxia-specific microenvironments. Stoichiogenomics explores environmental resource limitation on biological macromolecules in terms of element usages. However, the patterns of oxygen usage by proteins and the ways that proteins adapt to a cancer hypoxia microenvironment are still unknown. Here we compared the oxygen and carbon contents ([C]) between proteomes of stomach cancer (hypoxia) and two stomach glandular cells (normal). Key proteins, genome locations, pathways, and functional dissection associated with stomach cancer were also studied. An association of oxygen content ([O]) and protein expression level was revealed in stomach cancer and stomach glandular cells. For differentially expressed proteins (DEPs), oxygen contents in the up regulated proteins were3.2%higherthan that in the down regulated proteins in stomach cancer. A total of 1,062 DEPs were identified; interestingly none of these proteins were coded on Y chromosome. The up regulated proteins were significantly enriched in pathways including regulation of actin cytoskeleton, cardiac muscle contraction, pathway of progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation, etc. Functional dissection of the up regulated proteins with high oxygen contents showed that most of them were cytoskeleton, cytoskeleton associated proteins, cyclins and signaling proteins in cell cycle progression. Element signature of resource limitation could not be detected in stomach cancer for oxygen, just as what happened in plants and microbes. Unsaved use of oxygen by the highly expressed proteins was adapted to the rapid growth and fast division of the stomach cancer cells. In addition, oxygen usage bias, key proteins and pathways identified in this paper laid a foundation for application of stoichiogenomics in precision medicine."
3,"Extent of resection in surgery of stomach carcinoma The extraluminal extent of resection in cases of advanced gastric cancer is controversial. If, however, following meticulous staging--including the detection of free abdominal tumor cells--complete resection seems possible, then multivisceral resection is justified. If complete resection is achieved, the prognosis of these patients can be improved. Left pancreatic resection should be performed only if the tumor invades the pancreas directly. Splenectomy is indicated if the tumor invades the organ directly or if there are locally advanced tumors of the proximal third of the stomach and tumors of the esophageal-gastric junction. However, it has to be kept in mind that splenectomy is an independent negative prognostic factor. The extent of lymphadenectomy (LA) in gastric cancer is still under discussion. According to the 10-year results of the Dutch Gastric Cancer Study, there might be subgroups which have a survival benefit after extended (D2) LA. These include, as the German Gastric Cancer Study corroborated, patients with very early stage II and stage IIIa lymph node metastases. As neither of these stages can at present be diagnosed before or during surgery, D2 lymphadenectomy should be the standard procedure for all patients with gastric cancer. Recent studies have shown that it might be possible with the help of the Sentinel Node Technique to individualize lymphadenectomy in locally gastric cancer as well. The beneficial effects of adjuvant chemoradiation in gastric cancer do not mean, however, that the extent of resection may be reduced. Adjuvant chemoradiation following complete resection and D2 lymphadenectomy should still not be regarded as standard therapy."
3,"Cancer incidence patterns in Koreans in the US and in Kangwha, South Korea Objective: In the US, Koreans are a rapidly growing group and comprised 10.5% of the total Asian population as of 2000. However, little has been published regarding cancer patterns in this subpopulation. Methods: Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program, the California Cancer Registry, and the International Association for Research on Cancer, we compared age-adjusted and age-specific incidence rates for cancers of the prostate, breast, cervix, lung, colon, rectum, stomach, liver, and esophagus in US Koreans with rates of these cancers in residents of Kangwha, South Korea, and in US whites as a reference. Results: While the most frequently diagnosed cancer was lung among US Korean males and breast among US Korean females, it was stomach cancer for both sexes in Kangwha. Rates of prostate, breast, and colon cancer were considerably higher for Koreans in the US than in Kangwha, but were not as high as in whites. Cervical and stomach cancers showed the opposite racial/ethnic pattern, with rates highest in Kangwha, intermediate among US Koreans, and lowest among whites. Rates of rectal cancer in females and esophageal cancer in males were two-times higher in Kangwha than in US Koreans but esophageal cancer rates were similar between US Koreans and whites. Liver cancer rates were similar between Kangwha residents and US Koreans, but nearly 10-times lower among whites. Conclusions: Although these comparisons may have methodologic limitations, including data quality and racial/ethnic misclassification, the differences seen in migrant and native Koreans for some cancers warrant further investigation in this growing subpopulation."

3,"Differential responses of scirrhous and well-differentiated gastric cancer cells to orthotopic fibroblasts. Scirrhous gastric cancer cells proliferate rapidly with fibrosis, when the cancer cells invade into the submucosa of the stomach. To investigate the mechanisms responsible for the rapid proliferation, the growth interaction between gastric cancer cells and fibroblasts was examined. Human gastric cancer cell lines established from scirrhous carcinoma or well-differentiated adenocarcinoma were used. Human fibroblast cell lines were obtained from various organs. The growth interaction between gastric cancer cells and fibroblasts was examined by calculating the number of cancer cells or by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation of cancer cells. Gastric fibroblasts specifically stimulated the growth of scirrhous gastric cancer cells, but not that of well-differentiated adenocarcinoma cells. The growth factor(s) produced from gastric fibroblasts were then partially purified and characterised. The growth-promoting factor(s) had apparent molecular weights of 10000 dalton and was sensitive both to heat and proteinase treatment. No inhibition for the factor(s) was achieved with defined anti-growth factor antibodies. In this study, differential responses of scirrhous and well-differentiated gastric cancer cells to orthotopic fibroblasts were shown. Rapid proliferation of scirrhous gastric carcinoma should be partly controlled by orthotopic fibroblasts. The growth factor(s) from gastric fibroblasts, which was distinct from various defined growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), basic fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) may play an important role in the progression of scirrhous gastric cancer cells."
3,"Population density and cancer incidence differentials in New York State, 1978-82. Patterns of cancer incidence within five population density quintiles in New York State, exclusive of New York City, were investigated between 1978 and 1982. Sex-specific, standardized incidence ratios were calculated within each population density quintile for all cancer cases combined and for site-specific cancers based on cancer incidence patterns exhibited by the general population of New York State, exclusive of New York City. Areas with the highest population density demonstrated a 13 percent excess of cancer cases among males and a seven percent excess among females. In contrast, areas with the lowest population density exhibited lower cancer incidence, among both males (12 percent less) and females (12 percent less). Males demonstrated a significant, direct linear relationship between increasing population density and all cancer sites combined, and for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, liver, pancreas, larynx, lung, bladder, brain, and nervous system, and for Hodgkin's disease and multiple myelomas. Among females, a significant, direct linear relationship was observed between increasing population density and all cancer sites combined, and for cancers of the buccal cavity and pharynx, esophagus, stomach, lung, breast, and kidney. Malignant melanomas of the skin, and in situ and invasive cancers of the cervix exhibited unusual incidence patterns across the population density quintiles. These data are most useful in generating hypotheses for further studies to define specific etiologic factors operating within population density groupings. Population density, as measured in this investigation, may represent a surrogate measure for other factors which are related to cancer morbidity."
3,"Occupational cancer mortality among urban women in the former USSR. Occupational cancer mortality was evaluated among approximately three million female pensioners from urban areas of the former USSR. In 1970, these women experienced 14,918 cancer deaths. Occupational data were obtained from death certificates and the 1970 USSR National Population Census. Thirty-five occupational groups, including nine predominantly professional or office-work groups and 26 groups involving physical labor, were evaluated. The expected mortality rates were based on the urban female population of the USSR in 1970. Data for all cancer sites combined, and cancers of the esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, lung, breast, cervix, and hematopoietic system are presented. Among all female pensioners, there were significant increases of all cancers combined (rate ratio [RR]=1.05), and cancers of the breast (RR=1.3), cervix (RR=1.3), and the hematopoietic system (RR=1.2), and a significant deficit of cancer of the esophagus (RR=0.8). Many well-established associations between cancer and occupation among men were observed among the study group of female pensioners, such as stomach and lung cancer among miners, and hematopoietic malignancies among scientists and physicians. Other associations, to be investigated further, also were observed, such as excess lung cancer among waitresses. The peak employment period for this cohort of women was during World War II and the postwar period, when Soviet women outnumbered men almost two-to-one. Consequently, many of the women held jobs that are typically held by men. Thus, this study provides valuable information on occupational risks to women that may be relevant in other countries where women increasingly are being employed in jobs traditionally held by men."
3,"Feasibility and Nutritional Impact of Laparoscopy-assisted Subtotal Gastrectomy for Early Gastric Cancer in the Upper Stomach Laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG) is commonly performed for early gastric cancer (EGC) in the upper stomach; however, the incidence of anastomotic complications remains high, and postoperative nutritional status is not satisfactory. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and nutritional impact of a novel surgical procedure, laparoscopy-assisted subtotal gastrectomy (LAsTG). This was a retrospective study of 167 patients with EGC in the upper stomach. Of these, 57 patients underwent LAsTG, while 110 patients underwent LATG. Postoperative change in body weight, and serum concentration of albumin (Alb) and total protein (TP) were compared between the LAsTG and LATG groups. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to assess the influence of potential confounding factors. Frequency of anastomotic complications was significantly higher in the LATG group (16.3 %) than in the LAsTG group (5.3 %, P = 0.040). Postoperative recovery of body weight at 12 months after surgery was significantly better in the LAsTG group (89.8 ± 1.4 %) than in the LATG group (82.1 ± 1.0 %, P < 0.001). By ANCOVA, adjusted mean differences of Alb and TP at 12 months after surgery between the LAsTG and LATG groups were 0.226 g/dl (95 % CI 0.141–0.312; P < 0.001) and 0.380 g/dl (95 % CI 0.265–0.495; P < 0.001); thus, the surgical procedure was significantly associated with the postoperative Alb and TP levels. LAsTG could be a better choice than LATG for EGC in the upper stomach as a result of improvements in the incidence of anastomotic complications and postoperative nutritional status."
3,"A case of gastric and duodenal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma with multiple gastric cancers: a case report. Gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is often caused by Helicobacter pylori and has a good prognosis. Rarely, patients with MALT lymphoma may have gastric cancer and have a poor prognosis. We herein report a case in which surgical treatment was achieved for a 72-year-old male patient with gastric and duodenal MALT lymphoma coexisting multiple gastric cancers. He underwent upper endoscopy for epigastric discomfort, which revealed mucosal erosion on the posterior wall of the middle body of the stomach, an elevated lesion on the duodenal bulb, and a raised tumor on the antrum of the stomach. He was diagnosed with gastric and duodenal MALT lymphoma with early gastric cancer. One month after H. pylori eradication, a second upper endoscopy revealed no improvement in the gastric or duodenal mucosa, and areas of strong redness with a shallow recess just below the cardia of the stomach. As a result, a diagnosis of gastric and duodenal MALT lymphoma with two gastric cancers was made. Total gastrectomy with proximal duodenum resection using intraoperative upper endoscopy and regional lymph node dissection was performed. Pathologically, gastric and duodenal MALT lymphoma and three gastric cancers were detected. Since one of them was an advanced cancer, he started taking S-1 after his general condition improved. For early detection of gastric and duodenal MALT lymphoma or gastric cancer, appropriate upper endoscopy and a biopsy are important. It is necessary to select a suitable treatment, such as H. pylori eradication, endoscopic treatment, surgery, chemotherapy, and irradiation, according to the disease state."
3,"Initial results from a multi-center population-based cluster randomized trial of esophageal and gastric cancer screening in China. We initiated the first multi-center cluster randomized trial of endoscopic screening for esophageal cancer and gastric cancer in China. The objective of the study was to report the baseline screening findings in this trial. We recruited a total of 345 eligible clusters from seven screening centers. In the intervention group, participants from high-risk areas were screened by endoscopy; in non-high-risk areas, high-risk individuals were identified using a questionnaire and advised for endoscopy. Lugol’s iodine staining in esophagus and indigo carmine dye in stomach were performed to aid in the diagnosis of suspicious lesions. The primary outcomes of this study were the detection rate (proportion of positive cases among individuals who underwent endoscopic screening) and early detection rate (the proportion of positive cases with stage 0/I among all positive cases). A total of 149,956 eligible subjects were included. The detection rate was 0.7% in esophagus and 0.8% in stomach, respectively. Compared with non-high-risk areas, the detection rates in high-risk areas were higher, both in esophagus (0.9% vs. 0.1%) and in stomach (0.9% vs. 0.3%). The same difference was found for early-detection rate (esophagus: 92.9% vs. 53.3%; stomach: 81.5% vs. 33.3%). The diagnostic yield of both esophagus and stomach were higher in high-risk areas than in non-high-risk areas, even though in non-high-risk areas, only high-risk individuals were screened. Our study may provide important clues for evaluating and improving the effectiveness of upper-endoscopic screening in China.

3,"Gradual tube dilation method before percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy for obstructive esophageal cancer In patients with obstructive esophageal cancer (OEC) with stenosis of the tract to the stomach, the percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) procedure cannot be performed if the endoscope is unable to pass through to the stomach. Our aim was to describe the safety and utility of the gradual tube dilation method (GTD) before PEG in cases of OEC. This study enrolled 38 consecutive patients. If an ultrathin transnasal endoscope (UTNE) could successfully reach the stomach through the esophageal stenosis, then PEG was performed without using the GTD. If even the UTNE could not be passed to the stomach, PEG was performed after the GTD. The GTD shows the method that gradually increases the size from an 8 Fr to 16 Fr nasogastric tube which passed through the obstruction before performing PEG. We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who received the GTD. The complications were examined from the first UTNE to the completion of PEG. Seventeen of 38 patients received the GTD. All 17 patients successfully underwent the PEG procedures. The intubation period was 9.8 ± 3.4 days. The mean number of replacements was 2.5. Regarding complications, only three of the 17 patients experienced a sore throat. No significant differences were found in the PEG procedure times between the patients with the GTD and those without the GTD (P = 0.360). If patients with progressive esophageal cancer, such as OEC, need to undergo PEG, then the GTD is considered to be a useful modality for dilating the stenosis simply and safely."
3,"Cancer-associated fibroblasts-derived VCAM1 induced by H. pylori infection facilitates tumor invasion in gastric cancer. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a major role in the progression of stomach cancer, but the related mechanisms are not fully understood. H. pylori infection is recognized as one of the strongest risk factors for gastric carcinoma, but its effects on CAFs remain unknown. We aimed to determine the causative relationship between H. pylori infection in fibroblasts and the promoted cancer pathogenesis and progression in gastric cancer. Primary CAFs and normal activated fibroblasts (NAFs) were generated from gastric cancer patients. Gene signature of H. pylori-infected human stomach fibroblasts was performed using the RNA-seq analysis. Spheroid cell invasion assay and zebrafish cell line-derived xenograft (zCDX) model were introduced to evaluate tumor invasion induced by CAFs. The molecule interactions were determined using the kinetic binding analysis with the Biolayer Interferometry (BLI). Clinical significance and relevance were also assessed using the database analyses. H. pylori infection activated stomach fibroblasts and caused multiple gene alterations, including vascular adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1). H. pylori infection increased VCAM1 expression in CAFs in gastric carcinoma via activation of JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway, and VCAM1 levels were positively associated with tumor progression and dismal prognosis in stomach cancer patients. Furthermore, CAFs-derived VCAM1 molecularly interacted with integrin αvβ1/5 in gastric cancer cells facilitated tumor invasion in vitro and in vivo. Our results identify a novel mechanism underlying CAFs to promote tumor invasion during H. pylori infection. These studies facilitate us for a better understanding of the molecular process of gastric carcinoma progression, and provide the potential strategies for gastric cancer therapy."
3,"Comparison of long-term survival and immediate postoperative liver function after laparoscopic and open distal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer patients with liver cirrhosis Several studies have suggested no difference in the liver function of early gastric cancer (EGC) patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) between laparoscopic and open distal gastrectomy. However, the number of patients and comparison of long-term survival rates between the two groups are limited. The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term survival and immediate postoperative liver function of EGC patients with LC after laparoscopic and open distal gastrectomy. The clinical data of EGC patients with LC who had no other malignancy and underwent distal gastrectomy at Asan Medical Center between January 2005 and April 2013 were investigated retrospectively. All patients were divided into two groups: the open group (OG) and laparoscopic group (LG). The clinicopathologic data of the two groups were compared. The number of patients in each group was 48 and 27 in the OG and LG, respectively. There were no significant differences in the age, sex ratio, ASA score, cause of liver cirrhosis, preoperative Child-Pugh classification, tumor location, TNM stage, total postoperative drain amount, albumin, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, prothrombin time, morbidity and recurrence rate. Shorter hospital stay, longer operative time and more retrieved lymph nodes were observed in LG. The long-term overall survival rate was not different between the two groups (P = 0.356). For EGC patients with liver cirrhosis, especially Child A cirrhosis, laparoscopic or laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy can be a safe surgical procedure in comparison to open distal gastrectomy in terms of the long-term survival rate and immediate postoperative liver function."
3,"Side overlap esophagogastrostomy to prevent reflux after proximal gastrectomy. No optimal method of reconstruction for proximal gastrectomy has been established because of problems associated with postoperative reflux and anastomotic stenosis. It is also important that the reconstruction is easily performed laparoscopically because laparoscopic gastrectomy has become widely accepted in recent years. We have developed a new method of esophagogastrostomy, side overlap with fundoplication by Yamashita (SOFY). The remnant stomach is fixated to the diaphragmatic crus on the dorsal side of the esophagus. The esophagus and the remnant stomach are overlapped by a length of 5 cm. A linear stapler is inserted in two holes on the left side of the esophageal stump and the anterior gastric wall. The stapler is rotated counterclockwise on its axis and fired. The entry hole is closed, and the right side of the esophagus is fixated to the stomach so that the esophagus sticks flat to the gastric wall. The surgical outcomes of the SOFY method were compared with those of esophagogastrectomy different from SOFY. Thirteen of the 14 patients in the SOFY group were asymptomatic without a proton pump inhibitor, but reflux esophagitis was observed in 5 of the 16 patients in the non-SOFY group and anastomotic stenosis was observed in 3 patients. Contrast enhancement findings in the SOFY group showed inflow of Gastrografin to the remnant stomach was extremely good, and no reflux into the esophagus was observed even with patients in the head-down tilt position. SOFY can be easily performed laparoscopically and may overcome the problems of postoperative reflux and stenosis."
3,"Cost of illness of the stomach cancer in Japan - a time trend and future projections Stomach cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in Japan. The objectives of this study were to estimate and project the economic burden associated with stomach cancer in Japan, and to identify the key factors that drive the economic burden of stomach cancer. We calculated Cost of illness (COI) of 1996, 2002, 2008, 2014 and 2020 by using government office statistics and the COI method. We calculated direct cost and indirect cost (morbidity cost and mortality cost), and estimated the COI by summing them up. The number of deaths remained at approximately 50,000 in 1996–2008. COI was in downward trend from 1,293.5 billion yen in 1996 to 1,114.2 billion yen in 2008. Morbidity cost was 85.6 billion yen and 54.0 billion yen, mortality cost was 972.3 billion yen and 806.4 billion yen, and mortality cost per person was 19.4 million yen and 16.1 million yen in 1996 and 2008, respectively. Decrease of mortality cost that accounted for a large part of the COI (72.4% in 2008) was the major contributing factor. COI is predicted to decrease if the trend of health related indicators continues (442.8-1,056.1 billion yen depending on the model in 2020). Mortality cost per person is also predicted to decrease (9.5-12.5 million yen depending on the model in 2020). If the trend of health related indicators continues, it is estimated that COI of stomach cancer would decrease. “Aging”, “change of the healthcare providing system” and “new medical technology” are considered as contributing factors of COI."
3,"Dissemination of Free Cancer Cells from the Gastric Lumen and from Perigastric Lymphovascular Pedicles during Radical Gastric Cancer Surgery Manipulation and improper handling of a tumor during surgery may increase the risk of cancer cell dissemination after a curative gastrectomy. This study investigated the effect of improper handling of lymphovascular pedicles of stomach on tumor spillage during surgical procedure. Thirty-eight gastric cancer patients were enrolled. Three pairs of wash samples were obtained from each patient: (1) intraperitoneal wash samples obtained before (P0) and after gastrectomy (P1), (2) intragastric wash samples obtained before any manipulation (G0) and just before resection of the stomach (G1), and (3) ex vivo wash samples obtained by rinsing resected stomach with the lymphovascular pedicles closed by clips (S0) or with the pedicles open (S1). Cytologic examination was performed from all washes, and real-time reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction analysis for carcinoembryonic antigen was performed from washes P0, P1, S0, and S1. Cytologic examination detected cancer cells in 34.2% (13 of 38) of G0 samples and in 39.5% (15 of 38) of G1 samples. The rate of conversion from G0-negative to G1-positive increased as T stage increased. Cytologic examination detected cancer cells in 2.6% (1 of 38) of S0 samples and in 13.2% (5 of 38) of S1 samples. The carcinoembryonic antigen mRNA level of the S1 sample was 2-fold greater than that of the S0 sample in 50.0% (7 of 14). Free cancer cells can be released from gastric lumen or lymphovascular pedicles opened during gastric cancer surgery, especially in advanced-stage disease. Care should be taken to minimize spillage from the gastric lumen and lymphovascular pedicles."

3,"Case-control study of gastric cancer screening in Venezuela. A screening programme for early gastric cancer was introduced in the state of Tachira, Venezuela, in 1980. Screening was performed by photofluorography, using two mobile units. The efficacy of this programme in reducing mortality from stomach cancer was evaluated by means of a case-control study. Cases were 241 individuals who died from stomach cancer in the period 1985-89. Ten live controls per case were drawn from the electoral rolls, matched by sex, age and residence. Exposure to the screening examination of cases and controls was assessed through individual linkage with the programme's centralised database. After the exclusion of examinations occurring within the 6 months preceding the case's diagnosis, the odds ratio (OR) of dying from stomach cancer for those screened was 1.26 (CI 0.83-1.91) and the OR in females was lower than in males: 0.77 (CI 0.33-1.78) and 1.52 (CI 0.94-2.47) respectively. Odds ratios associated with years since last test and number of tests did not differ significantly from 1. These results show the inefficacy of the programme in reducing mortality from gastric cancer in the area. In an attempt to determine whether this result was due to selection bias, an analysis restricted to subjects who had been screened at least once was performed. When examinations occurring after an index date at various intervals before the case's diagnosis were excluded, the screening test appeared to protect from death, although confidence intervals of the odds ratios are large, for example OR = 0.47 (CI 0.24-0.98) when excluding tests within 1 month."
3,"Reframing gastric lymph nodes as a parapancreatic lymph chain: an embryology-driven rationale for omento-bursectomy and omentum-preserving gastrectomy to facilitate safe infrapyloric lymph node dissection. The infrapyloric lymph nodes (LNs) are defined as No. 6 LNs and as one of the regional gastric LNs in the Japanese classification of gastric carcinoma. No. 6 LNs are recommended to be dissected completely even in D1 lymphadenectomy for distal and total gastrectomy in the Japanese Gastric Cancer Treatment Guideline. Omento-bursectomy, whose survival advantage for advanced gastric cancer patients was not shown by the Japanese Clinical Oncology Group 1001 trial, has been proposed to be a useful technique for safe and secure dissection of No. 6 LNs in gastric cancer surgery. In the present review, we first discuss the reason why omento-bursectomy is considered to be a useful technique for dissection of No. 6 LNs, reframing the gastric LNs as a parapancreatic lymph chain based on the dorsal pancreas, mesogastrium, and mesoduodenum embryology. Second, we introduce the outermost layer-oriented dissection (OLD) of No. 6 LNs in performing an omentum-preserving gastrectomy (OPG) devised at Fujita Health University and their favorable outcomes. Last, we discuss the reason why the incidence of postoperative pancreatic fistula in laparoscopic distal gastrectomy is significantly higher than open gastrectomy for stage Ⅰ gastric cancer patients, for whom the OPG is likely performed, in a retrospective cohort study based on the Japanese National Clinical Database. Although single-institution retrospective clinical studies are referenced in this review, it is considered that reframing the gastric LNs as a parapancreatic lymph chain based on the embryology can enhance safe No.6 LNs dissection in the various types of gastric cancer surgery."
3,"A new approach to breast cancer analysis through histopathological images using MI, MD binary, and eight class classifying techniques Globally, cancer is the second deadliest disease in the world. The most familiar type of cancers affecting human beings is lung, colorectal, breast, cervical, stomach, thyroid, and stomach cancer. An individual affected by cancer suffers from physical, emotional, and financial restrain. The proper maintenance of the health system with early detection reduces the cancer death rate. Breast cancer is the most serious crisis that affects a major percentage of women. The superfluous intensification of cells in the breast is the main reason for breast cancer. The histopathological images are very useful in the diagnosis of breast cancer. However, it is a time-intensive and tedious task requiring long years of pathologist training. Today’s digital advancements can be exploited for automating this task. This paper presents a new learning approach for automating breast cancer Classifying is histopathological images into magnification independent (MI) and magnification dependent (MD) eight-class and binary classifying. For learning, we use the deep neural network-ResNet-18 and this is provided with Image Net training. The proposed learning technique mainly depends on the accurate tuning of the block-wise approach in which the deep network model's two terminal residual blocks can be educated. Additionally, we reinforced the proposed approach’s adaptability with Global Contrast Normalization and a three-fold rise in details concerning training data. The evaluation is carried out on Break His dataset. The results protrude our proposed technique to be effective in classifying breast cancer histopathological images into MI and MD eight-class and binary classes. It outperformed 11 renowned existing techniques."
3,"Cancer in the Sami population of Sweden in relation to lifestyle and genetic factors The reindeer herding Sami of Sweden have low incidences of cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate the cancer risk in a large cohort of Swedish Sami, containing Sami with different lifestyle and genetic Sami heritage. A cohort of 41,721 Sami identified in official national registers between 1960 and 1997, was divided into two sub-populations - reindeer herding Sami (RS) and non-reindeer herding Sami (NRS). A demographically matched non-Sami reference population (NS) was used as standard when incidence and mortality ratios were calculated. Incidence and mortality data were obtained from the Swedish Cancer and Cause of Death Registers for the period 1961–2003. For Sami men, lower risks were found for cancers of the colon and prostate, and for malignant melanoma and non-Hodkins lymphoma, but higher for stomach cancer. The Sami women showed higher risks for cancers of the stomach and the ovaries, but lower risk for cancer of the bladder. The RS demonstrated lower relative cancer risks compared with the NRS. The lowest relative risk was found among the RS men, while the highest were observed among the NRS women. The RS men who had adopted a more westernized lifestyle showed a similar relative risk for prostate cancer as that of the NS living in the same region. Most of these differences in cancer risks could probably be ascribed to differences in lifestyle. It is concluded that the traditional Sami lifestyle contains elements, e.g. dietary contents and physical activity that may protect them from developing cancer."
3,"Predicting lymph node status in early gastric cancer Accurate prediction of lymph node (LN) status is of crucial importance for appropriate treatment planning in patients with early gastric cancer (EGC). However, there is no definitive consensus yet on which patient and/or tumor characteristics are associated with LN metastasis. A systematic search for studies investigating the relationship between patient and/or tumor characteristics and LN metastasis in EGC was performed in PubMed/MEDLINE. Patient and/or tumor characteristics associated with LN metastasis were identified by meta-analyzing results of individual studies. Forty-five studies were included. Variables significantly associated with LN metastasis in gastric cancer limited to the mucosa were: age younger than 57 years, tumor location in the middle part of the stomach, larger tumor size, macroscopically depressed tumor type, tumor ulcerations, undifferentiated tumors, diffuse tumor type according to the Lauren classification, lymphatic tumor invasion, tumors with a proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) labeling index of more than 25%, and matrix metalloproteinase-9-positive tumors. Variables significantly associated with LN metastasis in gastric cancer limited to the submucosa were: female sex, tumor location in the lower part of the stomach, larger tumor size, undifferentiated tumors, increasing depth of submucosal invasion, lymphatic tumor invasion, vascular tumor invasion, increased submucosal vascularity, tumors with a PCNA labeling index of more than 25%, tumors with a gastric mucin phenotype, and vascular endothelial growth factor-C-positive tumors. We identified several variables associated with LN metastasis in EGC. These variables should be included in future research, in order to assess which of these variables remain as significant predictors of LN metastasis."

3,"Does remnant gastric cancer really differ from primary gastric cancer? A systematic review of the literature by the Task Force of Japanese Gastric Cancer Association. Remnant gastric cancer, most frequently defined as cancer detected in the remnant stomach after distal gastrectomy for benign disease and those cases after surgery of gastric cancer at least 5 years after the primary surgery, is often reported as a tumor with poor prognosis. The Task Force of Japanese Gastric Cancer Association for Research Promotion evaluated the clinical impact of remnant gastric cancer by systematically reviewing publications focusing on molecular carcinogenesis, lymph node status, patient survival, and surgical complications. A systematic literature search was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE with the keywords ""remnant,"" ""stomach,"" and ""cancer,"" revealing 1154 relevant reports published up to the end of December 2014. The mean interval between the initial surgery and the diagnosis of remnant gastric cancer ranged from 10 to 30 years. The incidence of lymph node metastases at the splenic hilum for remnant gastric cancer is not significantly higher than that for primary proximal gastric cancer. Lymph node involvement in the jejunal mesentery is a phenomenon peculiar to remnant gastric cancer after Billroth II reconstruction. Prognosis and postoperative morbidity and mortality rates seem to be comparable to those for primary proximal gastric cancer. The crude 5-year mortality for remnant gastric cancer was 1.08 times higher than that for primary proximal gastric cancer, but this difference was not statistically significant. In conclusion, although no prospective cohort study has yet evaluated the clinical significance of remnant gastric cancer, our literature review suggests that remnant gastric cancer does not adversely affect patient prognosis and postoperative course."
3,"Estimating the impact of a cancer diagnosis on life expectancy by socio-economic group for a range of cancer types in England Differences in cancer survival exist across socio-economic groups for many cancer types. Standard metrics fail to show the overall impact for patients and the population. The available data consist of a population of ∼2.5 million patients and include all patients recorded as being diagnosed with melanoma, prostate, bladder, breast, colon, rectum, lung, ovarian and stomach cancers in England between 1998 and 2013. We estimated the average loss in expectation of life per patient in years and the proportion of life lost for a range of cancer types, separately by deprivation group. In addition, estimates for the total number of years lost due to each cancer were also obtained. Lung and stomach cancers result in the highest overall loss for males and females in all deprivation groups in terms of both absolute life years lost and loss as a proportion of expected life remaining. Female lung cancer patients in the least- and most-deprived group lose 14.4 and 13.8 years on average, respectively, that is translated as 86.1% and 87.3% of their average expected life years remaining. Melanoma, prostate and breast cancers have the lowest overall loss. On the basis of the number of patients diagnosed in 2013, lung cancer results in the most life years lost in total followed by breast cancer. Melanoma and bladder cancer account for the lowest total life years lost. There are wide differences in the impact of cancer on life expectancy across deprivation groups, and for most cancers the most affluent lose less years."

3,"Dietary protein intake and stomach cancer, insights from a case-control study. Studies on the role of protein intake in the development of stomach cancer (SC) remain controversial. This study examines the relationship between protein intake from whole foods and SC in a Vietnamese population. A case-control study was designed in the university hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam, from 2003 to 2019. Participants included 1182 SC cases and 2995 controls. Of the participants, 2,580 were men, and 1,597 were women. Protein intake was assessed using a validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire. The odds ratio and 95% confidence interval (OR, 95%CI) examined the risk of SC associated with total protein and subgroups of mammal-animals and fish-poultry protein. Overall protein intake was negatively associated with SC (fifth vs. first quintile: OR (95%CI): 0.41 (0.32, 0.51). The dose-response relationship was also observed per increment quintile, OR (95%CI): 0.81 (0.77, 0.86) for both genders, OR (95%CI): 0.82 (0.77, 0.88) in men, OR (95%CI): 0.80 (0.73, 0.87) in women, OR (95%CI): 0.82 (0.77, 0.86) for noncardiac and OR (95%CI): 0.79 (0.63, 1.00) for cardiac stomach cancer. The beneficial effects of SC remained for the protein sources from mammal-animals and fish-poultry protein. The significant inverse association between protein intake remained in the ever and never tobacco smoking, no-alcohol use and alcohol use, blood group A and AB, and O, H. Pylori infected group, and the status of body-mass-index. The findings suggest that a high-protein diet is associated with lower SC risk. Further investigation is warranted to understand the beneficial effect of protein intake against stomach cancer."
3,"Influence of Damaged Stomach on Anastomotic Leakage following Cervical Esophagogastrostomy in Patients with Esophageal Cancer Anastomotic leakage (AL) is one of the most common complications after esophagectomy. Although some patients have a history of peptic ulcers or other prior stomach diseases, the influence of a damaged stomach (DS) on AL incidence remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the association between DS and incidence of AL in patients who underwent esophagectomy. Between 2015 and 2019, a total of 447 consecutive patients who underwent cervical esophagogastrostomy using gastric tube following esophagectomy were enrolled. DS was defined on the basis of endoscopic findings of ulcers or scars due to medical history or prior treatment. We compared the incidence of AL between patients with DS and those with a healthy stomach (HS). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify factors that could predict AL incidence. Fifty-one patients (11.4%) had DS. Causes of DS included peptic ulcer (n = 36), endoscopic resection for early gastric cancer (n = 9), percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomies (n = 5), and post-chemotherapy scar for gastric malignant lymphoma (n = 1). Overall, AL occurred in 35 patients (7.8%). The incidence of AL in the DS group was significantly higher than in the HS group (15.7 vs. 6.8%, p = 0.03). DS was one of the independent predictive factors for AL (odds ratio, 2.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.10–6.92; p = 0.03) on multivariate analysis. Further, the diseases in the lower third of the conduit were associated with AL. Presence of DS can predict AL in patients who underwent cervical esophagogastrostomy after esophagectomy."
3,"Family history of gastric cancer: a correlation between epidemiologic findings and clinical data. The pathogenetic mechanisms behind gastric cancer are still unclear. Its familial aggregation, on the other hand, has been very well documented by many epidemiologists. Nonetheless, only a limited number of studies have analyzed possible correlations between demographic and clinical data. Between January 1988 and August 2004, 541 patients underwent gastric resection with a curative intent at our department; demographic information, laboratory data, imaging, operative notes, and pathology reports were available for all patients. During 2004 we conducted a series of structured interviews with the surviving patients or their closest relatives regarding oncological family history, limited to first-degree relatives. Family history could be obtained in 383 patients (70.8%). Gastric cancer was by far the most frequently associated tumor: 21.9% of the overall number of tumors reported in the family histories were gastric cancers. Patients were also subdivided into those having at least one other family member with stomach cancer (71 patients; 18.5%) and those with no relatives affected by gastric cancer (312 patients; 81.5%). No statistically significant differences between the groups were observed regarding the primary tumor location, size, pTNM classification, and ABO or Rh blood types. However, the intestinal histotype was significantly (P = 0.015) more frequently represented in individuals with at least one family member affected by gastric cancer compared with those with no relatives with stomach cancer (71.8% vs 55.1%, respectively). Stomach cancer has a relevant degree of familial aggregation and in our series of patients, this was even more pronounced for the intestinal histotype."
3,"Mediastinal lymph node dissection and distal esophagectomy is not essential in early esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma. Optimal extent of surgery remains controversial in types 2 and 3 adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction (AEG). We aimed to determine whether the extended procedure including mediastinal lymphadenectomy is essential in all patients with AEG by comparing prognosis and recurrence of proximal gastric adenocarcinoma based on total gastrectomy with intra-abdominal lymphadenectomy. The clinicopathologic characteristics of 672 patients (type 2: 90, type 3: 211, upper third of the stomach: 371 cases) who underwent curative total gastrectomy with lymphadenectomy between 2003 and 2009 were reviewed. Recurrence was observed in 36.7, 16.1, and 16.1% of cases of type 2 AEG, type 3 AEG, and cancer of the upper third of the stomach, respectively. The 5-year disease-free survival rates were 62.6, 82.5, and 84.6%, respectively. Subgroup analysis revealed that in early cancers, there was no difference in survival between the groups (93.2 vs. 96.7 vs. 98.7%) but in advanced cancers, there was a difference (47.9 vs. 75.4 vs. 71.8%, P < 0.001). There was no survival difference in stage 1 (97.5 vs. 98.7 vs. 98.3%), but, in stage 2, type 2 AEG had a worse prognosis (41.9 vs. 92.1 vs. 83.0%). Types 2 and 3 advanced AEG had higher rates of locoregional recurrence, especially in the vicinity of the esophagojejunostomy and mediastinal lymph nodes compared to proximal gastric cancer. Total gastrectomy without mediastinal lymphadenectomy might produce favorable outcomes in early AEG and acquisition of a greater length of proximal margin, and removal of mediastinal lymph nodes might be helpful in advanced cancers."
3,"Risk factors and prognosis of gastric stasis, a crucial problem after laparoscopic pylorus-preserving gastrectomy for early middle-third gastric cancer Pylorus-preserving gastrectomy (PPG) is a function-preserving procedure for cT1N0 gastric cancer located in the middle-third of stomach, which is currently performed through a laparoscopic approach (LPPG). PPG is sometimes associated with a crucial problem during the early postoperative course, designated gastric stasis. However, information regarding gastric stasis remains to be fully elucidated. The study included 897 patients who underwent LPPG between 2005 and 2017. Early postoperative gastric stasis (E-stasis) was defined when the following conditions were fulfilled: upper abdominal distension, remnant stomach fullness on radiography image, and period of starvation exceeding 72 h within 1 month postoperatively. To evaluate long-term outcomes of E-stasis, late postoperative food residue (L-residue) was defined as grade 2 or higher food residue endoscopically according to the RGB (residue, gastritis, bile) classification at 1 year postoperatively. Risk factors and long-term outcomes of E-stasis were retrospectively analyzed. E-stasis was the most common complication during the early postoperative course. E-stasis occurred in 68 (7.6%) patients. Multivariate analysis identified age (≥ 61 years), DM, and postoperative intraabdominal infection as risk factors. At 1 year postoperatively, relative body weight ratio and postoperative serum albumin in the patients who experienced E-stasis was significantly lower than those in the other patients (P = 0.042 and 0.011, respectively). Of the patients who suffered from E-stasis, 42.5% experienced L-residue. E-stasis after LPPG occurs in 7.6% of patients. Age, DM, and intraabdominal infection are significantly related to E-stasis. E-stasis is associated with poorer nutritional and functional outcomes even at 1 year postoperatively."
3,"Tautomycin: An inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A but not a tumor promoter on mouse skin and in rat glandular stomach Tautomycin isolated fromStreptomyces spiroverticillatus is an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A. Tautomycin induced hyperphosphorylation of cytokeratin peptides in human keratinocytes (PHK 16-I cells) 30 times less strongly than did okadaic acid. Repeated applications of tautomycin (30 μg, 40 nmol/application) did not induce tumor promotion in a two-stage carcinogenesis experiment on mouse skin initiated with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, whereas okadaic acid (1 μg, 1.2 nmol/application) as a control induced tumor promotion strongly. As for mucosa or rat glandular stomach, tautomycin induced ornithine decarboxylase 4 h after intubation into the stomach. The tumor-promoting activity of tautomycin was next studied in the glandular stomach initiated withN-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). Administration of tautomycin in the diet (1 mg rat−1 day−1), from week 9 to week 52 of the experiment, inhibited rather than enhanced tumor development in the glandular stomach initiated with MNNG. The percentages of tumor-bearing rats of the groups treated with MNNG plus tautomycin, MNNG alone, and tautomycin alone were 20.0%, 40.6%, and 0% respectively in week 52. The reason for the absence of tumor-promoting activity of tautomycin was studied in relation to tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), an endogenous tumor promoter. We found that tautomycin neither enhanced TNFα mRNA expression in mouse skin nor induced TNFα release in a human stomach cancer cell line (KATO III cells), whereas okadaic acid did both. These results indicate that not all inhibitors of protein phosphatases are tumor promoters, and suggest that tumor promotion of the okadaic acid class of compounds is mediated by TNFα."
3,"Deciphering Aflatoxin B1 affected critical molecular pathways governing cancer: A bioinformatics study using CTD and PANTHER databases. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is a fungal toxin consistently found as a contaminant in food products such as cereals, nuts, spices, and oilseeds. AFB1 exposure can lead to hepatotoxicity, cancer, immune suppression, reproductive deficiency, nutritional dysfunction, and growth impairment. AFB1 has also been listed as one of the most potent human carcinogens by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Although the correlation between AFB1 exposure and cancer initiation and progression is already reported in the literature, very little information is available about what molecular pathways are affected during cancer development. Considering this, we first selected AFB1-responsive genes involved in five deadliest cancer types including lung, colorectal, liver, stomach, and breast cancers from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). Then, using the PANTHER database, a statistical overrepresentation test was performed to identify the significantly affected pathways in each cancer type. The gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRHR) pathway, the CCKR signaling pathway, and angiogenesis were found to be the most affected pathways in lung, breast, liver, and stomach cancers. In addition, AFB1 toxicity majorly impacted apoptosis and Wnt signaling pathways in liver and stomach cancers, respectively. Moreover, the most affected pathways in colorectal cancer were the Wnt, CCKR, and GnRHR pathways. Furthermore, gene analysis was also performed for the most affected pathways associated with each cancer and identified thirteen key genes (e.g., FOS, AKT1) that may serve as biological markers for a particular type of AFB1-induced cancer as well as for in vitro AFB1 toxicological studies using specific cancer cell lines."

In contrast, stomach cancer showed the greatest decline, followed by colorectal cancer, esophageal cancer, and biliary tract cancer. Most GI cancers predominantly affect men and tend toward a younger age of onset. Geographic disparities exist in the burden of GI cancers and their risk factors. For esophageal, stomach, and colorectal cancers, mortality rates linked to diet and smoking decreased, whereas alcohol-related mortality increased in several states, especially West Virginia. Hepatitis C remains the leading cause of liver cancer, with intravenous drug use as the primary risk factor. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the fastest-growing cause of liver cancer, followed by excessive alcohol use. Mortality rates for pancreatic cancer due to high body-mass index and high fasting plasma glucose have increased across states and age groups.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"">The epidemiological trends of GI cancers in the U.S. have shifted substantially.

3,"Clinicopathological features and prognosis of developed gastric cancer based on the diagnosis of mucosal atrophy and enlarged folds of stomach by double-contrast upper gastrointestinal barium X-ray radiography. Mucosal atrophy and enlarged folds of stomach by double-contrast upper gastrointestinal barium X-ray radiography (UGI-XR) are two major features of Helicobacter pylori-induced chronic gastritis. These were previously shown to be risk indicators of gastric cancer, but their predictability for clinicopathological characters of developed gastric cancer is unelucidated. In addition, evidence for decreasing the mortality of gastric cancer by appropriate follow-up of UGI screening is needed. The 5134 generally healthy UGI-XR examinees, who underwent follow-up UGI-XR or upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGI-ES) more than once, were prospectively observed for 10 years. At the beginning of follow-up, 1515 (29.5%) had mucosal atrophy and 990 (19.5%) had enlarged folds. For the serum anti-H. pylori IgG, 1301 (25.3%) were positive, 177 (3.4%) were possibly positive, and 3656 (71.2%) were negative. During the 10-year observation period, gastric cancer developed in 15 subjects, among which 13 had mucosal atrophy and 10 had enlarged folds. These two features were expectedly useful indicators for gastric cancer incidence, but they showed no significant association with tumor stage or histological type of developed cancer. Only one of the 5134 subjects died of gastric cancer during 10 years, which was significantly lower than the predicted number of gastric cancer death (6.78 for 10 years) according to the mortality rate in Japan. Neither mucosal atrophy nor enlarged folds of stomach showed a significant association with clinicopathological features of developed gastric tumors. Appropriate follow-up of cancer screening by UGI-XR or UGI-ES can reduce the risk of gastric cancer-related death."
3,"Hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Although gastric cancer occurs frequently in Japan, few cases of hepatoid adenocarcinoma, a cancer with an extremely poor prognosis, have been reported. Here, we describe a 67-year-old Japanese man referred to our hospital with suspected gastric cancer. Gastrointestinal fiberscopy revealed an elevated lesion with a central depression on the lesser curvature, extending from the antrum to the body of the stomach. On the preoperative examinations, abdominal computed tomography scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and abdominal ultrasonography revealed multiple metastases to the liver and no cirrhotic change. The serum level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was markedly elevated (10,084 ng/ml). After a diagnosis of AFP-producing gastric cancer with multiple liver metastases was made, total gastrectomy, without liver resection, was performed. Microscopically, the tumor showed two main histological features. The main part of the tumor resembled moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, and the rest showed fetal-type adenocarcinoma. Some parts of the hepatoma-like lesion showed periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive granules. Furthermore, the tumor showed diffuse immunohistochemical positivity for AFP, alpha-1 antitrypsin, and alpha-1 antichymotrypsin. According to these histopathological findings, the tumor was diagnosed as hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Although anastomotic leakage occurred postoperatively and the liver metastases have increased in size, the patient remains alive 11 months after the operation. Because of the poor prognosis for this histological type of tumor, accurate diagnosis of hepatoid adenocarcinoma is important, and long-term follow-up is required. We describe this rare case of hepatoid adenocarcinoma of the stomach, and review the literature concerning the clinicopathological aspects."
3,"Non-familial juvenile polyposis of the stomach with gastric cancers: a case report. Juvenile polyposis is an autosomal dominant inherited disease characterized by the development of numerous hamartomatous and nonneoplastic polyps of the gastrointestinal tract. Juvenile polyposis has also recently been reported as a predisposition for gastrointestinal cancer. A 63-year-old man underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy because of anemia and hypoalbuminemia during a follow-up for gastric polyposis, which showed multiple reddish polyps and two elevated lesions in the stomach. The elevated lesions were diagnosed as well-differentiated adenocarcinomas by biopsy. He had no specific physical findings or family history. Computed tomography showed gastric wall thickening without lymphadenopathy or distant metastasis. Colonoscopy showed an adenoma in the transverse colon. He underwent laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy. The resected specimen revealed numerous variously sized non-pedunculated polyps throughout the stomach, diagnosed histopathologically as hamartomatous polyps. The two elevated lesions were diagnosed as a well-differentiated adenocarcinoma restricted to the mucosa and a well-to-poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma invading the submucosa with prominent lymphatic permeation, respectively. Genetic analysis failed to identify any germline mutations in the genes usually associated with juvenile polyposis, including SMAD4 and BMPR1A. However, based on the few characteristic physical findings and histopathological features, the final diagnosis was juvenile polyposis restricted to the stomach. This patient represented a rare case of non-familial juvenile polyposis of the stomach with gastric cancers. Juvenile polyposis has malignant potential, and patients should therefore be carefully followed up. Surgical treatment, particularly total gastrectomy, is recommended as a standard treatment in patients with juvenile polyposis of the stomach with gastric cancer."
