1,"Primary liver cancer As several of the contributors point out in their introductory paragraphs, hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer, and the third most common cause of cancer death worldwide. The majority of patients have co-existent liver disease and, in some patients, advanced cirrhosis may be the life-limiting disease rather than cancer. Expert assessment of both the malignant and benign disease is therefore required in order to establish the optimal management, and a coordinated multidisciplinary approach is essential. Such an approach is reflected in the authorship of this book with contributions from surgeons, hepatologists, oncologists, radiologists and pathologists, although all are from North American institutions. The initial chapters deal with the aetiology of HCC and recommendations for surveillance. Unlike most cancers there are clear risk factors for the development of cirrhosis, which, once established, carries a 1–8% risk per year of developing HCC. Furthermore, as early disease is potentially curable, HCC meets some of the key criteria for screening; namely, a defined at-risk population and effective therapy for early disease. The problem is that both the currently used modalities, ultrasound and α-feto protein, have limited sensitivity and specificity for early disease. Chowdhury and Satoskar present an excellent overview of the evidence base for the current screening recommendations, and the chapters by Thomas and Oto on radiological diagnosis and by Pillai and Fimmel on emerging biomarkers inform the discussion. The HALT-C study, in which 1000 patients with Hepatitis C were followed prospectively for 4.3 years, demonstrated that the specificity and sensitivity of AFP at the time of diagnosis of HCC was 81 and 61% at 20 ng ml−1, while at 200 ng ml−1 the specificity increased to 100% at the expense of sensitivity, which decreased to 22%. AFP is also affected by patient demographic and underlying liver disease. Alternative markers including the lens culinaris agglutinin glycoform (AFP-L3), des-γ-carboxy prothrombin, α-ℒ-fucosidase, glypican 3 and others remain unproven, and no blood-based biomarker is currently recommended by the AASLD, EASL or EORTC guidelines. Proteomic approaches and measurements of microRNAs have so far failed to yield reproducible and reliable alternatives. In terms of imaging, ultrasound has an overall specificity of 40–80% and sensitivity of 80–100%, but only 25% sensitivity for early disease. Remarkably, only one randomised trial of screening has been performed and this was in China among an at-risk population of 18 000 with hepatitis B. Despite less than 60% adhering to the protocol, there was a 37% reduction in HCC-related mortality. Taking the results of this trial, along with numerous non-randomised prospective studies, the current recommendations are for 6 monthly ultrasound, but there is clearly more to be done to improve both the accuracy of the screening test and the application to the at-risk population. Additionally, at $112 993 per life-year saved, the cost is prohibitive in developing countries with a high incidence. Another promising method to reduce the burden of disease is prevention of known risk factors, which is discussed in the chapter by Dharel and Lau. Worldwide, 52% of patients with HCC have a background of hepatitis B and only 40% have established cirrhosis. With the development of a vaccination to hepatitis B, primary prevention has proved valuable in endemic regions, resulting in a reduction of childhood HCC from 0.52 to 0.13/100 000 since its implementation in 1984. Unfortunately 350 million people remain infected, and secondary prevention using interferon-α has been shown in a randomised trial to reduce the risk of developing HCC from 13 to 2.7%, although the benefit seems greater for those with suppressed HBV DNA. In the western countries and Japan, hepatitis C is present in 50% of those with HCC, but there is no established vaccine, and efforts have focussed on reducing transmission through the screening of blood products introduced in 1992. The risk from transfusion is now less than 0.03%. In patients infected with hepatitis C, interferon-α that causes a sustained virological response, reduces the risk of HCC by ∼75%. Other important risk factors, including cirrhosis secondary to alcohol and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, are preventable with lifestyle modification. Despite the known and preventable risks, HCC-associated mortality has increased by 40% between 1990 and 2004, while overall cancer deaths have declined by 18%.; ; Pathological and radiological diagnosis is discussed, along with a useful chapter devoted to the differential diagnosis of a ‘focal hepatic lesion'. The multitude of staging systems developed are also reviewed with the relative strengths and weaknesses discussed. The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) classification has proved to be one of the most widely used clinical staging system. It has been externally validated and is endorsed by both AASLD and EASL. In addition to prognostic information, the BCLC system provides a therapeutic algorithm that serves as a template for an overview of current therapies discussed by Susnow and colleagues. The accompanying chapter by Dhanasekaran and Cabrera examines emerging therapies that may demand modification of the BCLC system in the future. For early disease, the role of resection as a bridge to transplantation, expansion of the Milan criteria and the role of adjuvant therapy are considered. Novel ablative techniques are reviewed, although High Intensity Focussed Ultrasound (HIFU) is not mentioned. For intermediate disease, conventional transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) using lipiodol/chemotherapy emulsion is increasingly being replaced with the use of drug-eluting beads, and the benefit of combining systemic therapy with TACE is being explored. Transarterial radioembolisation (TARE) seems to be comparable to TACE in non-randomised cohort comparisons, but is struggling to find a place in the BCLC algorithm in the absence of randomised trials. Perhaps the most active area of clinical investigation is in the management of advanced disease. The success of sorafenib has dispelled the prevailing therapeutic nihilism, and a number of pretenders have challenged sorafenib to the throne in recent years. Since this book was published, several of the mentioned trials have been presented and we now know that suntinib, brivanib and the combination of sorafenib and erlotinib have failed in the first-line randomised trials. Second-line treatment following failure or intolerance to sorafenib is an area of intense investigation with multiple new agents under investigation, although discussion of these agents and the rational for their use was somewhat brief.; ; The book also includes excellent reviews of paraneoplastic syndromes, liver cancer in children, liver anatomy and the management of recurrent disease. Molecular pathology was not included and, given the increasing emphasis on personalised medicine, it would have been interesting to review some of the recent data regarding molecular categorisation of HCC.; ; Overall, this book provides an excellent reference for students, trainees and members of a multidisciplinary team wishing to gain additional insights into the domain of their colleagues."
1,"The Inhibitory Effects of Anti-GPC3 Antibody on Wnt/β-Catenin Signaling Pathway as a Biological Therapy in Liver Cancer. To investigate the effects of anti-GPC3 antibody on the Wnt/catenin pathway in liver cancer biology, thus providing a new target for the biological treatment of the disease. A total of 12 BALB/C experimental nude mice were selected as experimental objects. The mice were all male, weighed 15-20 g and aged 4-5 weeks. First, mouse liver cancer models were constructed. Then, the HepG2 liver cancer cells in logarithmic growth period were inoculated into the caudal veins of mouse models. On the 3rd day after inoculation, the tumor formations of nude mice were observed. Second, the anti-GPC3 antibody was designed and constructed, and the activity of anti-GPC3 antibody was detected. The mouse models were divided into the experimental group (EG) and the control group (CG), with 6 mice in each group. In the EG, mice were injected with 3 mg/kg of anti-GPC3 antibody in the caudal veins once a day for three consecutive days, while in the CG mice were injected with the same amount of saline as the control. Mice in both groups received 3 injections in total. After the last administration, all mice were euthanized using the decapitation method following anesthesia with ethyl ether. The liver cancer cells of nude mice were extracted and cultured in DMEM medium. The effects of anti-GPC3 antibody on Wnt/β-catenin in liver cancer nude mice and the effects of anti-GPC3 antibody on epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in mouse liver cancer cells were observed. The bodyweight, liver weight and index of mice in the EG increased significantly (P < 0.05). The serum alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels of mice in the EG were reduced than those in the CG (P < 0.05). Compared with the CG, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) concentration increased, while the malonaldehyde (MDA) concentration decreased in the liver tissues of mice in the EG (P < 0.05). There was binding activity between GPC3 recombinant protein and the antibody; the affinity constant was K<sub>D</sub> = 1.4 × 10<sup>-6</sup> M, compared with the commercial anti-GPC3 antibody, the affinity constant was lower. The interference effects of siRNA on anti-GPC3 antibody were detected by Western Blot. After the injection of anti-GPC3 antibody, the expression of β-catenin siRNA in liver cancer cells decreased significantly. The optical microscope images of mouse liver cancer cells in groups were compared. Through down-regulating the Wnt/β-catenin by anti-GPC3 antibody, the morphology of epithelial cells was maintained, the cells were arranged orderly, the cubic structure was kept stable, and the occurrence of EMT was reduced. However, in the CG, the structure of mouse liver cancer cells was disordered, the obvious EMT occurred (P < 0.05). Through down-regulating the expression of Wnt/β-catenin by anti-GPC3 antibody, the invasiveness, and metastasis of liver cancer cells could be effectively inhibited. Compared with the CG, the number of cells passing through the chamber was significantly reduced (P < 0.05). The anti-GPC3 antibody had inhibitory effect on Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. The occurrence of EMT and the invasiveness of liver cancer cells were inhibited effectively. Therefore, the anti-GPC3 antibody could be used as a reference for clinical molecular targeted therapy of liver cancer."

1,"The immunotherapy mechanism of Hedyotis Diffusae Herba in treating liver cancer: a study based on network pharmacology, bioinformatics, and experimental validation. Liver cancer is a malignant tumor that develops on or inside the liver. Hedyotis diffusa Willd (HDW) plays a significant role in anti-tumor activities; however, its mechanism against liver cancer remains unclear. This study aims to evaluate the immunotherapeutic mechanism of HDW in treating liver cancer through network pharmacology, bioinformatics analysis, and experimental validation. Network pharmacology was utilized to identify the active components and potential targets of HDW from the TCMSP database. A potential target protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the STRING database, followed by function and pathway enrichment analysis of the targets using GO and KEGG methods. In addition, the key targets for HDW against liver cancer were identified using five different algorithms in Cytoscape. The TCGA and HPA databases were used to assess the mRNA and protein expression of core target genes in normal liver and liver cancer tissues and their relationship with overall survival in liver cancer, as well as their role in immune infiltration. Molecular docking between the core components of HDW and the core targets was performed using PyMOL software. The effects of HDW on the proliferation and apoptosis of liver cancer cells were examined using MTT and flow cytometry. The regulatory effects of the core component quercetin on core targets were validated using RT-qPCR and Western blot. A total of 163 potential targets were identified by searching for intersections among 7 types of active components and all potential and liver cancer targets. PPI network analysis revealed the core targets IL6 and TNF. GO enrichment analysis involved 2089 biological processes, 76 cellular components, and 196 molecular functions. KEGG enrichment analysis suggested that the anti-cancer effects of HDW might be mediated by the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, IL-17 signaling pathway, TNF signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and NF-κB signaling pathway. Database validation of key targets showed that mRNA and protein expression results for the IL6 gene were contradictory, while those for the TNF gene were consistent, both being underexpressed in liver cancer. Importantly, the expression of IL6 and TNF was related to the infiltration of 24 types of immune cells, with the highest correlation with macrophages. Molecular docking showed that IL6 and TNF had high binding stability with quercetin, with binding energies of - 7.4 and - 6.0 kJ∙mol<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Experimental validation showed that quercetin inhibited liver cancer cell proliferation and promoted apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, with protein results indicating that quercetin downregulated the mRNA and protein expression of IL6 and TNF, and upregulated key proteins in the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, AGEs, and RAGE. This study comprehensively elucidates the activity, potential targets, and molecular mechanisms of HDW against liver cancer, providing a promising strategy for the scientific basis and treatment mechanism of traditional Chinese medicine in treating liver cancer."
1,"Insulin-like growth factors and liver cancer risk in male smokers Liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer worldwide (Bosch et al, 2004), occurs more commonly in men, and has a high fatality among affected patients. Although populations of developing countries have the highest risk with the primary cause being hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, a trend of increasing incidence has been observed in developed countries (McGlynn et al, 2001). Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for over 85% of cases, but underlying mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis are not completely understood and may vary across risk factors (Scharf and Braulke, 2003).; ; The liver is the primary source of circulating insulin-like growth factor(IGF)-I, a peptide hormone of which levels peak at puberty and decrease thereafter (Juul, 2003; Pavelic et al, 2007). IGF-I has been implicated in the regulation of cancer cells through effects on proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (Dunn et al, 1997; Pollak, 2000; Moschos and Mantzoros, 2002; Sachdev and Yee, 2007). Pituitary secretion of growth hormone stimulates hepatic IGF-I production, and more than 75% of circulating IGF-I is bound and regulated by IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3 (Ferry et al, 1999). Although previous studies showed an association between high serum concentrations of IGF-I and risk of prostate, colorectal, and breast cancers (Rowlands et al, 2009; Chan et al, 1998, 2002; Ma et al, 1999; Yu et al, 2002; Renehan et al, 2004), subsequent studies have found low IGF-I levels to be associated with an increased risk for brain and kidney cancer (Lonn et al, 2007; Major et al, 2010). Clinical studies suggest a possible inverse IGF-liver function association, although reverse causality, with low IGF-I levels being a consequence of liver damage, remains a possibility (Wu et al, 1988; Buzzelli et al, 1993). Several studies reported the reduced IGF levels to be independent of liver function and progression of disease, providing support for a potential causal connection (Stuver et al, 2000; Mazziotti et al, 2002; Mattera et al, 2003; Elsammak et al, 2006). However, these studies involved patients who already had cirrhosis or hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related liver disease.; ; Unlike above investigations, the α-Tocopherol, β-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study has a prospective design and involved a large population of men who, although being smokers, did not have liver cirrhosis, chronic alcohol abuse, or cancer at enrolment. In addition, the ATBC Study was conducted in Finland, a developed country with an extremely low prevalence of viral infections of the liver (e.g., HBV, HCV). We conducted a case–cohort study to assess the independent roles of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in liver cancer aetiology in a population without preexisting diseases that are known risk factors."
1,"Projected epidemiological trends and burden of liver cancer by 2040 based on GBD, CI5plus, and WHO data. Incidence of liver cancer as one of the most common cancers worldwide and become the significant contributor for the mortality among cancer patients. The disease burden, risk factors, and trends in incidence and mortality of liver cancer globally was described subsequently estimated the projections of liver cancer incidence or mortality by 2040. Data regarding age-standardized incidence and mortality rates for liver cancer was obtained from multiple databases, including GLOBOCAN 2020, CI5 volumes I-XI, WHO mortality database, and Global Burden of Disease (GBD)-2019. Concentrating on worldwide variations, this thorough analysis offers insights into patterns of incidence and mortality based on gender and age. Our findings encompass significant indicators, including age-standardized rates (ASRs), average annual percentage change (AAPC), and future projections extending up to the year 2040. Liver cancer holds the sixth position in terms of most frequently diagnosed cancers and stands as the sixth leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide in 2020, accounting for 905,677 new cases and 782,000 fatalities. Additionally, liver cancer contributed to 12,528,421 age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), with an age-standardized DALYs rate of 161.92 in 2019 worldwide. The age-specific incidence rates exhibited significant variations across different regions, showing a fivefold difference in males and females. A significant increase in incidence was observed in North Europe and Asia, while North African countries reported a higher mortality burden (ASR, 10 per 100,000) compared to developed countries. Since last few years, the incidence and mortality rates have increased and attained Annual Average Percentage Change (AAPC) incidence rate of 7.7 (95% CI 3.9-11.6) for men and the highest AAPC mortality rate of 12.2 (95% CI 9.5-15.0) for women. In 2019, Western Europe emerged as the high-risk region for DALYs related to smoking and alcohol consumption, while high-income North America carried a high risk for DALYs associated with a high body-mass index. The projected trend indicates a surge in new liver cancer incident cases, expected to rise from around 905,347 to an estimated 1,392,474 by 2040. This study described the evidence pertinent to higher incidence trends in liver cancer, particularly among both young and older adults, encompassing males and females, as well as those who are HIV-infected and HBsAg positive. A significant rise in the young population poses a significant public health concern that warrants attention from healthcare professionals to prioritize the promotion of health awareness and the development of effective cancer prevention strategies, particularly in many developing countries."
1,"Invasion and metastasis of liver cancer: expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1. To study the relationship between intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and liver cancer metastasis and to find predicting factors that could indicate the growth and metastasis of liver cancer. Methods: ICAM-1 expression in fresh tissue of normal liver and hepatocellular cancer (HCC) was examined by immunoperoxidase staining. Serum soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) from patients with a benign HCC tumor, and the expression of ICAM-1 in the orthotopically transplanted LCI-D20 tumor of a nude mouse liver cancer metastasis model, and in human hepatoma, the tumor surrounding tissue and normal liver, was analyzed semiquantitatively by the immuno-dot blot method. Tissue ICAM-1 expression (mRNA level) was detected by Northern blotting. Results: ICAM-1 expression in LD1-20 D metastatic liver cancer had a positive correlation with tumor size and the time after implantation. It increased suddenly as metastasis occurred being 3.03 ± 0.51 before metastasis and 8.24 ± 0.95 after metastasis, P < 0.01, then remained high, appending on the number of sites involved (monosite metastasis 5.48 ± 0.49, multisite metastasis 10.05 ± 1.17, P < 0.05). All six cases of normal liver samples were negative in anti-ICAM-1 immunohistochemical staining, 80.0% (36/45) of the HCC showed some ICAM-1 expression. The rate of positive cells was a little higher in large tumors, tumors with an intact capsule and tumors with metastasis, but there was no significant difference. It was noticed that two cancer emboli also had high ICAM-1 expression. The ICAM-1 concentration in HCC (13.43 ± 0.09) was higher than that in tumor surrounding the liver (5.89 ± 0.17, P < 0.01) and that in normal liver (4.27 ± 0.21, P < 0.01). sICAM-1, like tissue ICAM-1, was higher in HCC patients than in patients (with benign liver tumor and normal controls. Both tissue ICAM-1 and sICAM-1 were higher in the metastasis group than in the group without metastasis (tissue ICAM-1 20.24 ± 0.30 vs 10.23 ± 0.12 P < 0.05; sICAM-1 12.18 ± 0.25 vs 9.77 ± 0.54 P < 0.05). Northern blot analysis revealed that ICAM-1 expression, as indicated by mRNA level, was also higher in HCC and in cancer emboli than in tumor surrounding liver and normal liver. Conclusions: Tissue ICAM-1 and serum sICAM-1 could indicate the stage of HCC, and the potential of hepatoma cells for invasion and metastasis. They may play an important role in the metastasis cascade."
1,"The Demographic and Clinicopathological Characteristics of Hepatopancreatobiliary Cancers From a Specialized Center in India. Introduction Hepatopancreatobiliary (HPB) cancers are a distinct group requiring specialized multidisciplinary care. The present study was an analysis of HPB cancers. Methods The institutional data for two years from 2017 to 2018 was retrieved from the hospital-based cancer registry (HBCR) database in Excel format (Microsoft<sup>®</sup> Corp., Redmond, WA). The demographic details, method of diagnosis, tumor characteristics, and disease extent of the patients with HPB primary sites were retrospectively analyzed. Results Out of the 1417 patients with HPB malignancies, 1193 were analyzed. Most of the patients at our center hailed from North India. The distribution of HPB cancers was as follows: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (n=717, 60.1%), gallbladder (GB) (n=230, 19.3%), periampullary carcinoma (n=76, 6.37%), head of the pancreas (HOP) (n=55, 4.61%), extrahepatic bile duct (EBD) (n=53, 4.44%), intrahepatic bile duct (IBD) (n=32, 2.68%), and body of the pancreas (BOP) (n=30, 2.52%). The most common disease presentation of HPB cancers was in the seventh and sixth decades of life. Male predominance was seen in all HPB cancers except in GB with a higher incidence in females. The predominant cause of chronic liver disease (CLD) with HCC was viral-related (53.7%) with hepatitis B virus (HBV) (34.3%) higher than hepatitis C virus (HCV) (19.2%) followed by non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (24.8%) and then alcohol. Adenocarcinoma was the most common morphology in pancreatobiliary malignancies. The disease presentation was locoregional in 63.4% of HCC, 69.7% of periampullary carcinoma, and 50.9% of HOP cases. The patients with EBD and IBD cancers presented commonly with locoregional disease extent in 60.4% and 62.5%, respectively. Perihilar subsite was more commonly detected (71.7%) as compared to the distal one in the patients with EBD cancers. The patients with GB cancers (GBC) presented with distant metastases in 53.5% and locoregional disease in 33%. Distant metastases were present in 76.7% of the patients with BOP cancers. The liver was a common site of distant metastases in GB, periampullary, and pancreatic cancers. Conclusions The present study highlights the characteristics and the variations in disease presentation in different primary tumor sites of HPB cancers. In view of the common locoregionally advanced disease presentation of HCC, the patients with CLD need surveillance for the early detection of lesions. As the patients with HPB cancers show advanced disease presentation, effective locoregional and systemic therapies are needed."
1,"Dietary alterations modulate the microRNA 29/30 and IGF-1/AKT signaling axis in breast Cancer liver metastasis. Metastatic cancer is incurable and understanding the molecular underpinnings is crucial to improving survival for our patients. The IGF-1/Akt signaling pathway is often impaired in cancer leading to its progression and metastases. Diet modification is known to alter the IGF-1/Akt pathway and affect the expression of microRNA involved in tumor initiation, growth and metastases. Liver metastases are one of the most common type of metastases in breast and colon cancer. In the present study, we looked at the effect of diet modification on the expression of microRNA in normal liver and liver with breast cancer metastases using in vivo model. 6-month-old C57BL/6 J mice were put on either an ad libitum (AL) diet, or 40% calorie restricted (CR) diet or were fasted for 24 h (FA) before sacrifice. MicroRNA array analysis, western blot and qRT-PCR were performed using liver tissue to compare the treatment groups. A breast cancer model was also used to study the changes in microRNA expression in liver of a group of BALB/c mice orthotopically injected with 4 T1 cells in the mammary fat pad, put on either an AL or 30% CR diet. Liver and primary tumor tissues were used to perform qRT-PCR to compare the treatment groups. MicroRNA array analysis showed significant changes in miRNA expression in both CR and FA conditions in normal liver. Expression of miR-29 and miR-30 family members was increased in both CR and FA. Western blot analysis of the normal liver tissue showed that CR and FA downregulated the IGF-1/Akt pathway and qRT-PCR showed that the expression of miR-29b, miR-29c, miR-30a and miR-30b were increased with CR and FA. Liver tissue collected from mice in the breast cancer model showed an increase in expression of miR-29b, miR-29c and miR-30b while tumor tissue showed increased expression of miR-29c, miR-30a and miR-30b. Members of the miR-29 family are known to target and suppress IGF-1, while members of the miR-30 family are known to target and suppress both IGF-1 and IGF-1R. In the present study, we observe that calorie restriction increased the expression of miR-29 and miR-30 in both the normal liver as well as the liver with breast cancer metastases. These findings suggest that dietary alterations may play a role in the treatment of liver metastasis, which should be evaluated further."
1,"Trends and future projections of liver cancer incidence in Hong Kong: a population-based study. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Liver cancer remains a significant burden in Hong Kong. We sought to examine trends in liver cancer incidence using 30 years of cancer registry data in Hong Kong. Additionally, we aimed to assess the impact of age, period and birth cohort on liver cancer incidence, provided projections for liver cancer incidence until 2030, and examined the drivers of liver cancer incidence.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Data on liver cancer incidence were collected from the Hong Kong Cancer Registry (HKCaR). We assessed age, period, and birth cohort effects using age-period-cohort (APC) models. We employed Bayesian APC analysis with integrated nested Laplace approximations to project the future burden of liver cancer in Hong Kong. Furthermore, we attributed the changes in new liver cancer cases to population growth, population ageing, and epidemiological changes.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The study included a total of 51,333 individuals, of whom 39,287 (76.53%) were male. From 1991 to 2020, the age-standardized liver cancer incidence rate in Hong Kong continued declining, while the number of new cases increased significantly, especially among males. The net drift, representing the overall annual percentage change of the age-adjusted rate, was - 3.06% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -3.31% to -2.80%) for males and - 3.85% (95% CI: -4.61% to -3.09%) for females. Local drift, which estimates the annual percentage change over time specific to age group, decreased in all age groups for both sexes, with a more pronounced decrease in younger age groups. The period and cohort risk of developing liver cancer also showed decreasing trends for both sexes. The study projected a decline in liver cancer cases for males but an increase for females in Hong Kong, with an estimated 1,083 cases in males and 710 cases in females by 2030. Demographic decomposition analysis revealed that while population growth and ageing were the main drivers of increased liver cancer cases, epidemiologic shifts mostly offset these factors.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">The period and cohort risk of developing liver cancer in Hong Kong declined due to epidemiological changes. Although the age-standardized incidence rates of liver cancer have also declined, demographic and epidemiological factors have led to lower case expectations in males but a likely increase in females.

1,"Postoperative liver dysfunction in gastric cancer patients following early enhanced nutritional protocols: a retrospective observational study. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Postoperative liver dysfunction has been　recognized as a potential complication following gastric cancer surgery, particularly in the context of enhanced perioperative nutritional management. Although early supplementation with amino acids and fat emulsions has been introduced to optimize recovery, its impact on postoperative liver function remains insufficiently elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence, time course, and risk factors of postoperative liver dysfunction, and to assess the safety of early nutritional support in this context.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">This retrospective observational study included patients who underwent radical gastrectomy between January and July 2020 at Cancer Institute Hospital Ariake. All patients received early postoperative nutritional support including amino acid and fat emulsion supplementation. Liver function was assessed based on serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and total bilirubin (T-Bil) levels on postoperative days (POD) 1, 3, 7, as well as at the first outpatient visit. Postoperative liver dysfunction was defined according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. Risk factors for liver dysfunction on POD 7 were assessed using by univariate and multivariate analyses.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Data for 170 patients were analyzed. AST and ALT levels showed a biphasic pattern, with two distinct peaks observed on POD 1 and POD 7. The incidence rates of Grade 1 or higher elevations were 51.8% for AST and 39.4% for ALT on POD 1, and 47.9% for AST and 42.0% for ALT on POD 7. At the first outpatient visit, the incidence declined markedly. Univariate analysis identified acetaminophen use as a significant risk factor for liver dysfunction on POD 7 (p &lt; 0.05), with open surgery and extensive procedures showing trend-level associations. Multivariate analysis confirmed acetaminophen use as an independent risk factor. Importantly, no significant association was found between liver dysfunction and the administration of amino acids or fat emulsions, suggesting that early postoperative nutritional management appears to be safe.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Postoperative liver dysfunction is not uncommon in gastric cancer patients but is generally transient and clinically manageable. Early postoperative nutritional management, including amino acid and fat emulsion supplementation, appears to be safe and does not adversely affect postoperative liver function when appropriately administered. Careful monitoring of liver function, particularly in patients receiving acetaminophen, remains essential to optimize postoperative outcomes.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2025.

We calculated the spatial clustering degree of the common cancers using the global Moran's Index and identified the hotspot patterns using the hotspot analysis.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">We found that esophagus, stomach and liver cancer have a significantly higher spatial clustering degree ([Formula: see text]) than others. When by sex, female esophagus, male stomach, male esophagus, male liver and female lung cancer had significantly higher spatial clustering degree ([Formula: see text]). The spatial clustering degree of male liver was significantly higher than that of female liver cancer ([Formula: see text]), whereas the spatial clustering degree of female lung was significantly higher than that of male lung cancer ([Formula: see text]). The high-risk areas of esophagus and stomach cancer were mainly in North China, Huai River Basin, Yangtze River Delta and Shaanxi Province. The hotspots for liver and male liver cancer were mainly in Southeast China and south Hunan. Hotspots of female lung cancer were mainly located in the Pearl River Delta, Shandong, North and Northeast China. The Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta were high-risk areas for multiple cancers.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">The top highly clustered cancer types in mainland China included esophagus, stomach and liver cancer and, by sex, female esophagus, male stomach, male esophagus, male liver and female lung cancer. Among them, knowledge of their spatial patterns and environmental and behavioral risk factors is generally limited. Potential factors such as unhealthy diets, water pollution and climate factors have been suggested, and further investigation and validation are urgently needed, particularly for male liver cancer. This study identified the knowledge gap in understanding the spatial pattern of cancer burdens in China and offered insights into targeted cancer monitoring and control.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2022.

1,"Clinical significance of serum IL-18 and IL-18BP in patients with benign or malignant primary liver tumors OBJECTIVE To study the relationship between the serum levels of IL-18 and IL-18BP in the development and growth of primary liver cancer, benign liver tumors and liver cirrhosis and to determine the value of serum IL-18 and IL-18BP in the diagnosis of primary liver cancer. METHODS The serum levels of IL-18 and IL-18BP in 36 patients with primary hepatic carcinoma (PHC) were detected. Eighteen patients were diagnosed with various benign liver tumors and 21 patients with cirrhosis of liver (LC), determined by using an ELISA assay. The serum levels of AFP in 36 patients with primary liver cancer were examined. The relationship among levels of serum IL-18, IL-18BP and AFP in the primary liver cancer was explored. RESULTS The sIL-18 levels in PHC were signi fi cantly lower than in control group, the benign liver tumor group and the LC group. The sIL-18BP in PHC was signi fi cantly higher than that in control group, benign liver tumor group and LC group ( P < 0.001). There was a close correlation between the levels of IL-18, IL-18BP and clinical stage in PHC: the later clinical stages had lower levels of IL-18 and higher levels of IL-18BP while the earlier clinical stages had higher levels of IL-18 and lower levels of IL-18BP. There was a negative correlation between serum levels of IL-18 and AFP in the PHC group ( r  = -0.7152,  n = 36,  P < 0.01), and there was a positive correlation between serum levels of IL-18 BP and AFP in the patients with PHC (r  = 0.6315,  n = 36,  P < 0.01). The IL-18and IL-18BP in the patients with various benign liver tumors or LC were significantly higher than those in control group. The differences were statistically signifi cant ( P < 0.01). CONCLUSION Serum levels of IL-18 and IL-18BP can reflect the immune function of patients with primary liver cancer, with various benign liver tumors or with LC and can also be indicative of the clinic stage of primary liver cancer. It can be used to assist in making a diagnosis and in determining the clinical stage of PHC. Detecting AFP concurrently can help make the diagnosis of primary liver cancer more precise."
1,"Global and Country-Level Analysis of Liver Cancer: Disease Burden and Recent Trends. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Liver cancer is the sixth most prevalent cancer globally and the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality, with more than three-quarters of a million deaths. This has presented a significant challenge and imposed considerable strain on global public health systems. Therefore, evaluating the updated global burden of liver cancer and its recent trends in incidence and mortality is highly important, as it provides valuable insights for shaping public health policies and improving clinical practices.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">The data in our article were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 (GBD 2021), which is available at https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/ . In this study, liver cancer mortality and incidence were estimated via the cause of death ensemble (CODEm) model for every combination of sex, age, location, and year. The incidence was modelled with DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool. A linear regression model was employed to explore the temporal trend of these rates, formulated as y = α + βx + ε, where x represents the calendar year and y signifies the natural logarithm of the rate. For both incidence and mortality, the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) was computed via the formula 100 × (e<sup>β</sup> - 1), accompanied by a 95% confidence interval (CI).</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">First, 529,000 cases were newly diagnosed, with an age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) of 6.15 per 100,000 people. In terms of etiology, the incidence of liver cancer caused by metabolic factors has tended to increase. Additionally, the incidence of liver cancer was greater in males and older populations. Several specific regions presented liver cancer burdens that overwhelmingly surpassed the expected age-standardized rates (ASRs) each year from 1990 to 2021, regardless of their respective sociodemographic index (SDI) scores.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our findings reveal that liver cancer continues to pose a significant public health challenge. These findings suggest that targeted interventions are needed to address both the infectious and non-infectious drivers of liver cancer in different socioeconomic settings.

1,"Multiple liver metastases with synchronous gastric and transverse colon cancer diagnosed by gastric perforation successfully treated by SOX plus bevacizumab and completely resected by surgery: a case report. Synchronous double cancer of the colon and stomach accompanied by liver metastasis is rare. It is often difficult to determine an appropriate treatment strategy for multiple liver metastases of synchronous gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. Multidisciplinary treatment is required based on the progression and location of each tumor and chemotherapy for complete resection. A 57-year-old male who complained of acute abdominal pain and fever visited his local hospital. He underwent emergent surgery for peritonitis caused by a gastric perforation. The cytodiagnosis of ascites did not show any tumor cells. There was a liver metastasis in the lateral segment of the liver. We performed a primary closure of the defect and then applied an omentum flap. After surgery, the patient was diagnosed as having synchronous cStage IV transverse colon cancer with multiple liver metastases and cStage IIB gastric cancer. The [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) showed 18F-FDG uptake by the colon tumor and multiple liver metastases, but there was no uptake in the gastric tumor or lymph nodes. We retrospectively reevaluated the CT findings from a local hospital and detected a liver nodule in segment 2/3 (from 35 to 60 mm) and segment 6 (from 26 to 57 mm), and the tumors had dramatically grown in size in only 2 months. Because complete tumor resection would be difficult, S-1 and oxaliplatin (SOX) plus bevacizumab therapy was started to control tumor progression. After 20 courses of chemotherapy, the clinical diagnosis was ycStage IV transverse colon cancer and ycStage IIa gastric cancer. We planned a two-step procedure to completely resect the primary tumors and multiple liver metastases. We first performed a laparoscopic right-colon resection+D3 lymphadenectomy and open distal gastrectomy+D2 lymphadenectomy. The patient was discharged home on postoperative day 18. After 1 month, we performed open liver resection. The pathological findings showed that the transverse colon was ypT2 (MP) with grade 2 therapeutic effects and that there were no atypical cells in the gastric tumor and multiple liver nodules (pathological complete response). The SOX plus bevacizumab regimen could be an option for controlling tumor progression in synchronous double cancer of the colon and stomach with liver metastasis and led to the complete resection of such tumors."

1,"Safety and efficacy of Y-90 microsphere treatment in patients with primary and metastatic liver cancer: the tumor selectivity of the treatment as a function of tumor to liver flow ratio. Treatment records and follow-up data on 40 patients with primary and metastatic liver malignancies who underwent a single whole-liver treatment with Y-90 resin microspheres (SIR-Spheres® Sirtex Medical, Lake Forest, IL) were retrospectively reviewed. The objective of the study was to evaluate the anatomic and physiologic determinants of radiation dose distribution, and the dose response of tumor and liver toxicity in patients with liver malignancies who underwent hepatic arterial Y-90 resin microsphere treatment. Liver and tumor volume calculations were performed on pre-treatment CT scans. Fractional tumor and liver flow characteristics and lung shunt fractions were determined using hepatic arterial Tc-99m MAA imaging. Absorbed dose calculations were performed using the MIRD equations. Liver toxicity was assessed clinically and by liver function tests. Tumor response to therapy was assessed by CT and/or tumor markers. Of the 40 patients, 5 had hepatocellular cancer (HCC), and 35 had metastatic liver tumors (15 colorectal cancer, 10 neuroendocrine tumors, 4 breast cancer, 2 lung cancer, 1 ovarian cancer, 1 endometrial cancer, and 2 unknown primary adenocarcinoma). All patients were treated in a salvage setting with a 3 to 80 week follow-up (mean: 19 weeks). Tumor volumes ranged from 15.0 to 984.2 cc (mean: 294.9 cc) and tumor to normal liver uptake ratios ranged from 2.8 to 15.4 (mean: 5.4). Average administered activity was 1.2 GBq (0.4 to 2.4 GBq). Liver absorbed doses ranged from 0.7 to 99.5 Gy (mean: 17.2 Gy). Tumor absorbed doses ranged from 40.1 to 494.8 Gy (mean: 121.5 Gy). None of the patients had clinical venoocclusive disease or therapy-induced liver failure. Seven patients (17.5 %) had transient and 7 patients (17.5 %) had persistent LFT abnormalities. There were 27 (67.5%) responders (complete response, partial response, and stable disease). Tumor response correlated with higher tumor flow ratio as measured by Tc-99m MAA imaging. Doses up to 99.5 Gy to uninvolved liver are tolerated with no clinical venoocclusive disease or liver failure. The lowest tumor dose producing a detectable response is 40.1 Gy. The utilization of MAA-based imaging techniques to determine tumor and liver blood flow for clinical treatment planning and the calculation of administered activity may improve clinical outcomes."
1,"Association of the presence of allergic disease with subsequent risk of liver cancer in a nationwide retrospective cohort among Koreans. A number of studies have proposed an inverse association between allergic diseases and risk of cancer, but only a few studies have specifically investigated the risk of primary liver cancer, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of allergic diseases with risk of primary liver cancer. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of the Korean National Health Insurance Service database consisted of 405,512 Korean adults ages 40 and above who underwent health screening before January 1st, 2005. All participants were followed up until the date of liver cancer, death, or December 31st, 2013, whichever happened earliest. Those who died before the index date or had pre-diagnosed cancer were excluded from the analyses. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine the adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk of primary liver cancer according to the presence of allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis, asthma, and allergic rhinitis. The aHR (95% CI) for overall liver cancer among allergic patients was 0.77 (0.68-0.87) compared to those without allergic disease. Allergic patients had significantly reduced risk of HCC (aHR, 0.72; 95% CI 0.62-0.85) but not ICC (aHR, 0.95; 95% CI 0.73-1.22). The presence of allergies was associated with significantly lower risk of liver cancer among patients whose systolic blood pressure is lower than 140 mmHg (aHR, 0.64; 95% CI 0.62-0.78 for overall liver cancer; aHR, 0.64; 95% CI 0.52-0.78 for HCC) but this effect was not observed among patients whose systolic blood pressure is higher than 140 mmHg (aHR, 0.91; 95% CI 0.71-1.18 for overall liver cancer; aHR, 0.91; 95% CI 0.71-1.18 for HCC) The aHR (95% CI) for overall liver cancer of allergic patients with and without chronic hepatitis virus infection were 0.60 (95% CI 0.44-0.81) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.64-0.93), respectively. In addition, allergic patients without cirrhosis showed significantly lower risk of overall liver cancer (aHR, 0.73; 95% CI 0.63-0.83). Patients with allergic diseases have significantly lower risk of primary liver cancer compared to those without allergic diseases, which supports the rationale for immunotherapy as an effective treatment for liver cancer."

The high rate of liver involvement is attributed to the unique anatomical location of the GEJ, which is close to the liver. Patients with liver metastasis typically have advanced, unresectable disease and limited treatment options. Therefore, early detection and prediction are crucial to guide appropriate treatment planning and improve the outcomes for patients with GEJ cancer at risk of liver metastases. Using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, the present study aimed to elucidate the incidence and risk factors of liver metastases in GEJ cancer patients diagnosed between 2010 and 2019.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">This research employed univariable and multivariable logistic regression models to identify risk factors for the development of liver metastases.

1,"Colorectal cancer liver metastases – a population-based study on incidence, management and survival Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer-associated deaths with liver metastases developing in 25–30% of those affected. Previous data suggest a survival difference between right- and left-sided liver metastatic CRC, even though left-sided cancer has a higher incidence of liver metastases. The aim of the study was to describe the liver metastatic patterns and survival as a function of the characteristics of the primary tumour and different combinations of metastatic disease. A retrospective population-based study was performed on a cohort of patients diagnosed with CRC in the region of Stockholm, Sweden during 2008. Patients were identified through the Swedish National Quality Registry for Colorectal Cancer Treatment (SCRCR) and additional information on intra- and extra-hepatic metastatic pattern and treatment were retrieved from electronic patient records. Patients were followed for 5 years or until death. Factors influencing overall survival (OS) were investigated by means of Cox regression. OS was compared using Kaplan-Meier estimations and the log-rank test. Liver metastases were diagnosed in 272/1026 (26.5%) patients within five years of diagnosis of the primary. Liver and lung metastases were more often diagnosed in left-sided colon cancer compared to right-sided cancer (28.4% versus 22.1%, p = 0.029 and 19.7% versus 13.2%, p = 0.010, respectively) but the extent of liver metastases were more extensive for right-sided cancer as compared to left-sided (p = 0.001). Liver metastatic left-sided cancer, including rectal cancer, was associated with a 44% decreased mortality risk compared to right-sided cancer (HR = 0.56, 95% CI: 0.39–0.79) with a 5-year OS of 16.6% versus 4.3% (p < 0.001). In liver metastatic CRC, the presence of lung metastases did not significantly influence OS as assessed by multivariate analysis (HR = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.80–1.53). The worse survival in liver metastatic right-sided colon cancer could possibly be explained by the higher number of metastases, as well as more extensive segmental involvement compared with left-sided colon and rectal cancer, even though the latter had a higher incidence of liver metastases. Detailed population-based data on the metastatic pattern of CRC and survival could assist in more structured and individualized guidelines for follow-up of patients with CRC."

1,"Eribulin-induced liver dysfunction as a prognostic indicator of survival of metastatic breast cancer patients: a retrospective study Eribulin is a non-taxane, microtubule dynamics inhibitor that increases survival of patients with metastatic breast cancer. Although eribulin is well tolerated in patients with heavily pretreated disease, eribulin-induced liver dysfunction (EILD) can occur, resulting in treatment modification and subsequent poor disease control. We aimed to clarify the effect of EILD on patient survival. The medical records of 157 metastatic breast cancer patients treated with eribulin between July 2011 and November 2013 at Cancer Institute Hospital were retrospectively analyzed. EILD was defined as 1) an increase in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase levels >3 times the upper limit of normal, and/or 2) initiation of a liver-supporting oral drug therapy such as ursodeoxycholic acid or glycyron. Fatty liver was defined as a decrease in the liver-to-spleen attenuation ratio to <0.9 on a computed tomography scan. EILD occurred in 42 patients, including one patient for whom eribulin treatment was discontinued due to severe EILD. The patients who developed EILD had significantly higher body mass indices (BMIs) than those who did not develop EILD (24.5 vs. 21.5, respectively; P < 0.0001), with no difference in the dose intensity of eribulin between the two groups (P = 0.76). Interestingly, the patients with EILD exhibited significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than those without EILD (P = 0.010 and P = 0.032, respectively). Similarly, among 80 patients without liver metastasis, 19 with EILD exhibited significantly longer PFS and OS than the others (P = 0.0012 and P = 0.044, respectively), and EILD was an independent prognostic factor of PFS (P = 0.0079) in multivariate analysis. During eribulin treatment, 18 patients developed fatty liver, 11 of whom developed EILD, with a median BMI of 26.7. Although EILD and fatty liver occurred at a relatively high frequency in our study, most of the patients did not experience severe adverse effects. Surprisingly, the development of EILD was positively associated with patient survival, especially in patients without liver metastases. EILD may be a clinically useful predictive biomarker of survival, but further studies are needed to confirm these findings in another cohort of patients."
1,"PKM2 inhibition may reverse therapeutic resistance to transarterial chemoembolization in hepatocellular carcinoma Therapeutic options for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are limited. Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is an interventional procedure used to deliver chemotherapy and embolizing agents directly to the tumor and is the procedure of choice for patients with intermediate stage HCC. While effective, more than 40% of patients do not respond to therapy, highlighting the need to investigate possible mechanisms of resistance. We sought to evaluate mechanisms of TACE resistance and evaluate a potential therapeutic target to overcome this resistance. Using a prognostic gene signature which predicts TACE response (TACE Navigator) in a cohort of HCC patients who received TACE, patients were classified as responders and non-responders. Transcriptomic and gene pathway analysis were used to identify potential drivers of TACE resistance. Knockdown of the gene encoding rate limiting enzyme PKM2 using shRNA in HCC cell lines, as well as pharmacologic inhibition of PKM2 with shikonin using an in vitro TACE model measured response to chemotherapy under hypoxia. Finally, we replicated the TACE model with shikonin using patient derived cell line organoids (PDC). Functional studies were performed in vitro using immunoblotting, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, glycolysis and hypoxia assays. In patient non-responders, we identified enrichment of the glycolysis pathway, specifically of the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme PKM2. We identified four HCC cell lines which recapitulated a TACE responder-like and non-responder-like phenotype. PKM2 knockdown in HCC cell lines demonstrated a less proliferative and aggressive phenotype as well as improved drug sensitivity to both doxorubicin and cisplatin. In vitro TACE model demonstrated that TACE non-responder-like cells overcame therapeutic resistance and rendered them susceptible to therapy through PKM2 knockdown. Lastly, we obtained similar results using a pharmacologic PKM2 inhibitor, shikonin in both cell lines, and PDC organoids. Elevated PKM2 is associated with treatment resistance and abbreviated survival in patients receiving TACE. Elevated PKM2 in vitro is associated with increased utilization of the glycolysis pathway, resulting in oxygen independent cell metabolism. Through PKM2 knockdown as well as with pharmacologic inhibition with shikonin, non-responder cells can be reprogrammed to act as responders and could improve TACE efficacy in patients."
1,"The role of Neanderthal introgression in liver cancer. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Neanderthal introgressed DNA has been linked to different normal and disease traits including immunity and metabolism-two important functions that are altered in liver cancer. However, there is limited understanding of the relationship between Neanderthal introgression and liver cancer risk.

Using a previously generated set of Neanderthal alleles, we identified Neanderthal introgressed haplotypes. We then tested whether somatic mutations are enriched or depleted on Neanderthal introgressed haplotypes compared to modern haplotypes. We also computationally assessed whether somatic mutations have a functional effect or show evidence of regulating expression of Neanderthal haplotypes. Finally, we compared patterns of Neanderthal introgression in liver cancer patients and the general population.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">We find Neanderthal introgressed haplotypes exhibit an excess of somatic mutations compared to modern haplotypes. Variant Effect Predictor analysis revealed that most of the somatic mutations on these Neanderthal introgressed haplotypes are not functional. We did observe expression differences of Neanderthal alleles between tumor and normal for four genes that also showed a pattern of enrichment of somatic mutations on Neanderthal haplotypes. However, gene expression was similar between liver cancer patients with modern ancestry and liver cancer patients with Neanderthal ancestry at these genes. Provocatively, when analyzing all genes, we find evidence of Neanderthal introgression regulating expression in tumor from liver cancer patients in two genes, ARK1C4 and OAS1. Finally, we find that most genes do not show a difference in the proportion of Neanderthal introgression between liver cancer patients and the general population.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our results suggest that Neanderthal introgression provides opportunity for somatic mutations to accumulate, and that some Neanderthal introgression may impact liver cancer risk.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2022.

1,"Breast adenocarcinoma liver metastases, in contrast to colorectal cancer liver metastases, display a non-angiogenic growth pattern that preserves the stroma and lacks hypoxia. Although angiogenesis is a prerequisite for the growth of most human solid tumours, alternative mechanisms of vascularisation can be adopted. We have previously described a non-angiogenic growth pattern in liver metastases of colorectal adenocarcinomas (CRC) in which tumour cells replace hepatocytes at the tumour-liver interface, preserving the liver architecture and co-opting the sinusoidal blood vessels. The aim of this study was to determine whether this replacement pattern occurs during liver metastasis of breast adenocarcinomas (BC) and whether the lack of an angiogenic switch in such metastases is due to the absence of hypoxia and subsequent vascular fibrinogen leakage. The growth pattern of 45 BC liver metastases and 28 CRC liver metastases (73 consecutive patients) was assessed on haematoxylin- and eosin-stained tissue sections. The majority of the BC liver metastases had a replacement growth pattern (96%), in contrast to only 32% of the CRC metastases (P<0.0001). The median carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) expression (M75 antibody), as a marker of hypoxia, (intensity x % of stained tumour cells) was 0 in the BC metastases and 53 in the CRC metastases (P<0.0001). There was CA9 expression at the tumour-liver interface in only 16% of the BC liver metastases vs 54% of the CRC metastases (P=0.002). There was fibrin (T2G1 antibody) at the tumour-liver interface in only 21% of the BC metastases vs 56% of the CRC metastases (P=0.04). The median macrophage count (Chalkley morphometry; KP-1 anti-CD68 antibody) at the interface was 4.3 and 7.5, respectively (P<0.0001). Carbonic anhydrase 9 score and macrophage count were positively correlated (r=0.42; P=0.002) in all metastases. Glandular differentiation was less in the BC liver metastases: 80% had less than 10% gland formation vs only 7% of the CRC metastases (P<0.0001). The liver is a densely vascularised organ and can host metastases that exploit this environment by replacing the hepatocytes and co-opting the vasculature. Our findings confirm that a non-angiogenic pattern of liver metastasis indeed occurs in BC, that this pattern of replacement growth is even more prevalent than in CRC, and that the process induces neither hypoxia nor vascular leakage."
1,"Association of hepatitis status with surgical outcomes in patients with dual hepatitis B and C related hepatocellular carcinoma. The conception that serological hepatitis markers determined surgical prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) associated with hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C (HCV) has been well defined. However, little is known about the relationship between surgical outcomes and serological hepatitis markers in patients with dual HBV and HCV related HCC. A retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 39 HCC patients with HBV-HCV coinfection who underwent curative hepatectomy between 2001 and 2011 was performed. HBV DNA quantification, expression of HBV antigens, anti-HCV signal-to-cutoff ratio (S/CO) and some clinicopathological characteristics were investigated to show the potential relationship among them and the surgical prognosis. The Cox proportional hazards model identified that HBV DNA quantification of 1,000 IU/mL or higher, HBeAg seropositivity, tumor size of greater than 5 cm, multiple tumors, and vascular invasion were risk factors for HCC prognosis. Thus, HBV DNA quantification, HBsAg level, HBeAg status and HCV-Ab level which may reveal the hepatitis status were further analyzed. The overall survival time in the group with high (≥1,000 IU/mL) HBV DNA quantification was significantly lower than the group with low (<1,000 IU/mL) HBV DNA quantification. Similarly, the high HBsAg level (≥1,000 IU/mL) was associated with poor survival compared with the low HBsAg level. Moreover, HBeAg seropositivity determined a higher cumulative risk for death. However, no significant difference was observed in overall survival time between the groups with low (<10.9 S/CO) and high (≥10.9 S/CO) HCV-Ab level. Compared to HCV-Ab high-level group, the serological HBsAg level was observed significantly higher in HCV-Ab low-level group. Furthermore, the data we analyzed showed these 4 serological hepatitis markers were not correlated with cumulative recurrence rate. On multivariate analysis, none of serological hepatitis markers was an independent prognostic factor for HCC patients with dual hepatitis B and C. Among HCC patients with HBV-HCV coinfection, those who with preoperatively high HBV DNA quantification or HBeAg seropositivity had a short survival time and served as poor survival indicators. Serological expression of HBV status rather than HCV status might potentially dominate the surgical outcomes of the Chinese HCC patients with HBV-HCV coinfection."
1,"Calotropis gigantea stem bark extracts inhibit liver cancer induced by diethylnitrosamine. Several fractions of Calotropis gigantea extracts have been proposed to have potential anticancer activity in many cancer models. The present study evaluated the anticancer activity of C. gigantea stem bark extracts in liver cancer HepG2 cells and diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced primary liver cancer in rats. The carcinogenesis model induced by DEN administration has been widely used to study pathophysiological features and responses in rats that are comparable to those seen in cancer patients. The dichloromethane (CGDCM), ethyl acetate, and water fractions obtained from partitioning crude ethanolic extract were quantitatively analyzed for several groups of secondary metabolites and calactin contents. A combination of C. gigantea stem bark extracts with doxorubicin (DOX) was assessed in this study to demonstrate the enhanced cytotoxic effect to cancer compared to the single administration. The combination of DOX and CGDCM, which had the most potential cytotoxic effect in HepG2 cells when compared to the other three fractions, significantly increased cytotoxicity through the apoptotic effect with increased caspase-3 expression. This combination treatment also reduced ATP levels, implying a correlation between ATP and apoptosis induction. In a rat model of DEN-induced liver cancer, treatment with DOX, C. gigantea at low (CGDCM-L) and high (CGDCM-H) doses, and DOX + CGDCM-H for 4 weeks decreased the progression of liver cancer by lowering the liver weight/body weight ratio and the occurrence of liver hyperplastic nodules, fibrosis, and proliferative cells. The therapeutic applications lowered TNF-α, IL-6, TGF-β, and α-SMA inflammatory cytokines in a similar way, implying that CGDCM had a curative effect against the inflammation-induced liver carcinogenesis produced by DEN exposure. Furthermore, CGDCM and DOX therapy decreased ATP and fatty acid synthesis in rat liver cancer, which was correlated with apoptosis inhibition. CGDCM reduced cleaved caspase-3 expression in liver cancer rats when used alone or in combination with DOX, implying that apoptosis-inducing hepatic carcinogenesis was suppressed. Our results also verified the low toxicity of CGDCM injection on the internal organs of rats. Thus, this research clearly demonstrated a promising, novel anticancer approach that could be applied in future clinical studies of CGDCM and combination therapy."

1,"Attitude of patients with liver cancer toward clinical drug trials: empirical qualitative research. To explore the attitude of patients with liver cancer toward clinical drug trials and promote the development of clinical drug trials in patients with liver cancer. Qualitative study. In this study conducted in a tertiary hospital, we conducted in-depth interviews in 19 patients with liver cancer, including those who were: (1) diagnosed with primary liver cancer according to the ""Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Primary Liver Cancer (2022 Edition)""; (2) without cognitive or language impairment and were able to express their thoughts; and (3) willing to participate in the study and provided written informed consent. We excluded those with serious physical diseases or other malignant tumors and mental disorders. The attitudes of patients with liver cancer toward clinical drug trials were evaluated along with the awareness of clinical drug trials and factors affecting their participation in order to promote the development of clinical drug trials for this population. We summarized the attitude of patients to clinical drug trials into two themes. The first involved differences in patients' awareness of clinical drug trials, which comprised lack of awareness, doubts and worries, blind trust in authoritative sources, and rational participation. The second highlighted factors influencing participation in clinical drug trials, which included: (1) positive factors such as a doctor's recommendation, expectations, peer effect, economic burden, desire to contribute to medical research, and family support, and (2) negative factors consisting of the side effects of drugs, drug safety, and problems guaranteeing patients' rights and interests. There are significant differences in liver cancer patients' awareness and attitudes towards clinical drug trials. Enhancing patient education and addressing their concerns can improve participation rates. Effective use of physician recommendations, financial incentives, and family support are crucial in encouraging patient involvement in clinical trials. Researchers should improve the awareness of liver cancer patients with regard to clinical drug trials and understand the factors that affect their participation. : The patients had no contributions in the design or conduct of the study, analysis or interpretation of the data, or in the preparation of the manuscript."
1,"Impact of CDX2 expression status on the survival of patients after curative resection for colorectal cancer liver metastasis The prognostic biomarker for patients undergoing curative liver metastasectomy for colorectal cancer (CRC) is lacking. The purpose was to investigate the prognostic role of a lack of CDX2 expression, which has been proposed as a potential biomarker for high-risk relapse in early-stage CRC, in patients undergoing curative liver metastasectomy. A total of 396 consecutive patients with CRC liver metastasis who underwent potentially curative liver metastasectomy at a single center in Japan between 2005 and 2015 were included. For the immunohistochemical analysis of nuclear CDX2 expression, we adopted the tissue microarray approach using the resected metastatic liver CRCs. Patient subgroups were compared with respect to disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) by applying the Kaplan-Meier curve, log-rank tests, and multivariate analyses based on the Cox proportional hazards method. OS is defined as the period from the date of curative liver resection for metastatic CRC until death. DFS is defined as the length of time from curative liver resection to either the first recurrence or death. In patients without recurrence, the latest imaging inspection date was used as the censored date. Thirty-six of the 396 CRCs (9.1%) reduced CDX2 expression. The reduced expression of CDX2 was associated with poor differentiation (P = 0.02). DFS in days was lower in the patients with CDX2-low CRC than in the patients with CDX2-high CRC (median DFS: 245 days versus 420 days; hazard ratio for disease recurrence: 1.64; 95% confidence interval: 1.08–2.38; P = 0.02). OS in days was lower in the patients with CDX2-low CRC than in the patients with CDX2-high CRC (median OS: 1024 days versus 3145 days; hazard ratio: 2.41; 95% confidence interval: 1.52–3.85; P <  0.001). In patients with CDX2-low CRC, both DFS and OS were similar between the with and without pre- or post-operative chemotherapy groups (median DFS: 243 versus 247 days; P = 0.73, median OS: 1016 versus 1363 days; P = 0.69). Reduced expression of CDX2 indicates poor DFS and OS, however, it might not represent chemosensitivity in patients undergoing curative liver metastasectomy. (339/350)."
1,"CDCA8 as an independent predictor for a poor prognosis in liver cancer Human cell division cycle associated 8 (CDCA8) a key regulator of mitosis, has been described as a potential prognostic biomarker for a variety of cancers, such as breast, colon and lung cancers. We aimed to evaluate the potential role of CDCA8 expression in the prognosis of liver cancer by analysing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the difference in CDCA8 expression between liver cancer tissues and matched normal tissues. Then, we applied logistic regression and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test to identify the association between CDCA8 expression and clinicopathologic characteristics. Cox regression and the Kaplan–Meier method were used to examine the clinicopathologic features correlated with overall survival (OS) in patients from the TCGA. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to explore possible mechanisms of CDCA8 according to the TCGA dataset. CDCA8 expression was higher in liver cancer tissues than in matched normal tissues. Logistic regression and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test revealed that the increased level of CDCA8 expression in liver cancer tissues was notably related to T stage (OR = 1.64 for T1/2 vs. T3/4), clinical stage (OR = 1.66 for I/II vs. III/IV), histologic grade (OR = 6.71 for G1 vs. G4) and histological type (OR = 0.24 for cholangiocarcinoma [CHOL] vs. hepatocellular carcinoma [LIHC]) (all P-values < 0.05). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis indicated that high CDCA8 expression was related to a poor prognosis in liver cancer (P = 2.456 × 10−6). Univariate analysis showed that high CDCA8 expression was associated with poor OS in liver cancer patients, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.85 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.47–2.32; P = 1.16 × 10–7). Multivariate analysis showed that CDCA8 expression was independently correlated with OS (HR = 1.74; CI: 1.25–12.64; P = 1.27 × 10–5). GSEA revealed that the apoptosis, cell cycle, ErbB, MAPK, mTOR, Notch, p53 and TGF-β signaling pathways were differentially enriched in the CDCA8 high expression phenotype. High CDCA8 expression is a potential molecular predictor of a poor prognosis in liver cancer."
1,"Computational analysis for identification of early diagnostic biomarkers and prognostic biomarkers of liver cancer based on GEO and TCGA databases and studies on pathways and biological functions affecting the survival time of liver cancer Liver cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth most common cause of cancer death. The purpose of this work is to find new diagnostic biomarkers or prognostic biomarkers and explore the biological functions related to the prognosis of liver cancer. GSE25097 datasets were firstly obtained and compared with TCGA LICA datasets and an analysis of the overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was conducted. Cytoscape was used to screen out the Hub Genes among the DEGs. ROC curve analysis was used to screen the Hub Genes to determine the genes that could be used as diagnostic biomarkers. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards model screened genes associated with prognosis biomarkers, and further Gene Set Enrichment Analysis was performed on the prognosis genes to explore the mechanism affecting the survival and prognosis of liver cancer patients. 790 DEGs and 2162 DEGs were obtained respectively from the GSE25097 and TCGA LIHC data sets, and 102 Common DEGs were identified by overlapping the two DEGs. Further screening identified 22 Hub Genes from 102 Common DEGs. ROC and survival curves were used to analyze these 22 Hub Genes and it was found that there were 16 genes with a value of AUC > 90%. Among these, the expression levels of ESR1,SPP1 and FOSB genes were closely related to the survival time of liver cancer patients. Three common pathways of ESR1, FOBS and SPP1 genes were identified along with seven common pathways of ESR1 and SPP1 genes and four common pathways of ESR1 and FOSB genes. SPP1, AURKA, NUSAP1, TOP2A, UBE2C, AFP, GMNN, PTTG1, RRM2, SPARCL1, CXCL12, FOS, DCN, SOCS3, FOSB and PCK1 can be used as diagnostic biomarkers for liver cancer, among which FOBS and SPP1 genes can also be used as prognostic biomarkers. Activation of the cell cycle-related pathway, pancreas beta cells pathway, and the estrogen signaling pathway, while on the other hand inhibition of the hallmark heme metabolism pathway, hallmark coagulation pathway, and the fat metabolism pathway may promote prognosis in liver cancer patients."
1,"Analysis of prognostic factors of more/equal to10 years of survival for liver cancer patients after liver transplantation To investigate prognostic factors of  more than 10 years of survival for liver cancer patients after liver transplantation. From May 2000 to May 2007, a total of 134 liver cancer patients who underwent liver transplantation in the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Peking University People’s Hospital, were continuously and retrospectively enrolled. The patients included 120 males and 14 females. There were 124 cases (92.5%) of primary hepatocellular carcinoma, 9 cases (6.7%) of cholangiocarcinoma, and 1 case of mixed hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with perioperative death were excluded. Follow-up was performed until May 31st, 2017 or the time of death. According to the data on postoperative survival time, patients were divided into a   5 cm), vascular tumor thrombus (large blood vessel or non-large blood vessel), and histological differentiation degree. The Kaplan–Meier method was used to calculate survival rates. The log-rank method was used to compare the differences between survival curves. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to perform multivariate analyses of possibly influential factors. (1) Follow-up was conducted with all 134 liver cancer patients after liver transplantation. The follow-up periods were 1–201 months, with a median of 18 (8.75, 132.5) months. The Kaplan–Meier survival analysis results showed that the 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year cumulative survival rates were 70.3%, 48.6%, 46.8%, and 46.8%, respectively. (2) The differences in the age of patients, the incidence rate of AFP ≥ 400 µg/L, tumor histological differentiation, vascular tumor thrombi, tumor lesion size, and number of tumor lesions between two groups were all statistically significant (all P   5 cm (HR = 2.682, 95% CI 1.382–5.366), large blood vessel tumor thrombi (HR = 1.831, 95% CI 1.010–3.341), and poor histological differentiation (HR = 2.150, 95% CI 1.372–3.394), were risk factors affecting the 10-year survival of liver cancer patients after liver transplantation (all P < 0.05). Tumor size, tumor number, large blood vessel tumor thrombi, and low tumor differentiation were all found to be independent risk factors affecting the 10-year survival rate after liver transplantation in liver cancer patients."
1,"Granulocytic immune infiltrates are essential for the efficient formation of breast cancer liver metastases Breast cancer cells display preferences for specific metastatic sites including the bone, lung and liver. Metastasis is a complex process that relies, in part, on interactions between disseminated cancer cells and resident/infiltrating stromal cells that constitute the metastatic microenvironment. Distinct immune infiltrates can either impair the metastatic process or conversely, assist in the seeding, colonization and growth of disseminated cancer cells. Using in vivo selection approaches, we previously isolated 4T1-derived breast cancer cells that preferentially metastasize to these organs and tissues. In this study, we examined whether the propensity of breast cancer cells to metastasize to the lung, liver or bone is associated with and dependent on distinct patterns of immune cell infiltration. Immunohistocytochemistry and immunohistofluorescence approaches were used to quantify innate immune cell infiltrates within distinct metastases and depletion of Gr1+ (Ly-6C and Ly-6G) or specifically Ly-6G+ cells was performed to functionally interrogate the role of Ly-6G+ infiltrates in promoting metastasis to these organs. We show that T lymphocytes (CD3+), myeloid-derived (Gr-1+) cells and neutrophils (Ly-6G+ or NE+) exhibit the most pronounced recruitment in lung and liver metastases, with markedly less recruitment within bone metastatic lesions. Interestingly, these infiltrating cell populations display different patterns of localization within soft tissue metastases. T lymphocytes and granulocytic immune infiltrates are localized around the periphery of liver metastases whereas they were dispersed throughout the lung metastases. Furthermore, Gr-1+ cell-depletion studies demonstrate that infiltrating myeloid-derived cells are essential for the formation of breast cancer liver metastases but dispensable for metastasis to the lung and bone. A specific role for the granulocytic component of the innate immune infiltrate was revealed through Ly-6G+ cell-depletion experiments, which resulted in significantly impaired formation of liver metastases. Finally, we demonstrate that the CD11b+/Ly-6G+ neutrophils that infiltrate and surround the liver metastases are polarized toward an N2 phenotype, which have previously been shown to enhance tumor growth and metastasis. Our results demonstrate that the liver-metastatic potential of breast cancer cells is heavily reliant on interactions with infiltrating Ly-6G+ cells within the liver microenvironment."

1,"An age-period-cohort analysis of mortality rates for stomach, colorectal, liver, and lung cancer among prefectures in Japan, 1999–2018 Although change in the birth cohort effect on cancer mortality rates is known to be highly associated with the decreasing rates of age-standardized cancer mortality rates in Japan, the differences in the trends of cohort effect for representative cancer types among the prefectures remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the differences in the decreasing rate of cohort effects among the prefectures for representative cancer types using age-period-cohort (APC) analysis. Data on stomach, colorectal, liver, and lung cancer mortality for each prefecture and the population data from 1999 to 2018 were obtained from the Vital Statistics in Japan. Mortality data for individuals aged 50 to 79 years grouped in 5-year increments were used, and corresponding birth cohorts born 1920–1924 through 1964–1978 were used for analysis. We estimated the effects of age, period, and cohort on each type of mortality rate for each prefecture by sex. Then, we calculated the decreasing rates of cohort effects for each prefecture. We also calculated the mortality rate ratio of each prefecture compared with all of Japan for cohorts using the estimates. As a result of APC analysis, we found that the decreasing rates of period effects were small and that there was a little difference in the decreasing rates among prefectures for all types of cancer among both sexes. On the other hand, there was a large difference in the decreasing rates of cohort effects for stomach and liver cancer mortality rates among prefectures, particularly for men. For men, the decreasing rates of cohort effects in cohorts born between 1920–1924 and 1964–1978 varied among prefectures, ranging from 4.1 to 84.0% for stomach cancer and from 20.2 to 92.4% for liver cancers, respectively. On the other hand, the differences in the decreasing rates of cohort effects among prefectures for colorectal and lung cancer were relatively smaller. The decreasing rates of cohort effects for stomach and liver cancer varied widely among prefectures. It is possible that this will influence cancer mortality rates in each prefecture in the future."

However, liver cancer is still under-studied. The Early Detection of Hepatocellular Liver Cancer (DeLIVER-QResearch) project aims to address the research gap and generate new knowledge to improve early detection and diagnosis of primary liver cancer from general practice and at the population level. There are three research objectives: (1) to understand the current epidemiology of primary liver cancer in England, (2) to identify and quantify the symptoms and comorbidities associated with liver cancer, and (3) to develop and validate prediction models for early detection of liver cancer suitable for implementation in clinical settings.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">This population-based study uses the QResearch® database (version 46) and includes adult patients aged 25-84 years old and without a diagnosis of liver cancer at the cohort entry (study period: 1 January 2008-30 June 2021). The team conducted a literature review (with additional clinical input) to inform the inclusion of variables for data extraction from the QResearch database. A wide range of statistical techniques will be used for the three research objectives, including descriptive statistics, multiple imputation for missing data, conditional logistic regression to investigate the association between the clinical features (symptoms and comorbidities) and the outcome, fractional polynomial terms to explore the non-linear relationship between continuous variables and the outcome, and Cox/competing risk regression for the prediction model. We have a specific focus on the 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year absolute risks of developing liver cancer, as risks at different time points have different clinical implications. The internal-external cross-validation approach will be used, and the discrimination and calibration of the prediction model will be evaluated.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""DISCUSSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">The DeLIVER-QResearch project uses large-scale representative population-based data to address the most relevant research questions for early detection and diagnosis of primary liver cancer in England.

1,"A decade's studies on metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma. Metastasis remains one of the major challenges before hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is finally conquered. This paper summarized a decade’s studies on HCC metastasis at the Liver Cancer Institute of Fudan University. We have established a stepwise metastatic human HCC model system, which included a metastatic HCC model in nude mice (LCI-D20), a HCC cell line with high metastatic potential (MHCC97), a relatively low metastatic potential cell clone (MHCC97L) and several stepwise high metastatic potential cell clones (MHCC97H, HCCLM3, and HCCLM6) from their parent MHCC97 cell. Endeavors have been made for searching human HCC metastasis-related chromosomes/proteins/genes. Monogene-based studies revealed that HCC invasion/metastasis was similar to that of other solid tumors, and the biological characteristics of small HCC were only slightly better than that of large HCC. Using comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), genotyping, cDNA microarray, and 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis, we obtained some interesting results. In particular, in collaboration with the National Institute of Health (NIH) in the United States, we generated a molecular signature that can classify metastatic HCC patients, identified osteopontin as a lead gene in the signature, and found that genes favoring metastasis progression were initiated in the primary tumors. We also found that chromosome 8p deletion, particularly in the region of 8p23, was associated with HCC metastasis. Cytokeratin 19 was identified as one of the proteins, which was found in MHCC97H, but not in MHCC97L cells. Experimental interventions using the high metastatic nude mice model have provided clues for the prevention of HCC metastasis. Translation from workbench to bedside demonstrated that serum VEGF, microvessel density, and p53 scoring may be of value for the prediction of postoperative metastatic recurrence. Interferon alpha proved effective for the prevention of recurrence both experimentally and clinically. In conclusion, HCC metastasis that probably initiated in the primary tumor is a multigene-involved, multistep, and changing process. The further elucidation of the mechanism underlying HCC metastasis will provide a more solid basis for the prediction and prevention of the metastatic recurrence of HCC."
1,"Perioperative and oncologic outcomes of laparoscopic versus open liver resection for combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma: a propensity score matching analysis. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"">Laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) has now been established as a safe and minimally invasive technique that is deemed feasible for treating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). However, the role of LLR in treating combined hepatocellular-cholangiocarcinoma (cHCC-CC) patients has been rarely reported. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of LLR when compared with open liver resection (OLR) procedure for patients with cHCC-CC.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"">A total of 229 cHCC-CC patients who underwent hepatic resection (34 LLR and 195 OLR patients) from January 2014 to December 2018 in Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University were enrolled and underwent a 1:2 propensity score matching (PSM) analysis between the LLR and OLR groups to compare perioperative and oncologic outcomes. Overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) parameters were assessed by the log-rank test and the sensitivity analysis.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">A total of 34 LLR and 68 OLR patients were included after PSM analysis. The LLR group displayed a shorter postoperative hospital stay (6.61 vs. 8.26 days; p value &lt; 0.001) when compared with the OLR group. No significant differences were observed in the postoperative complications' incidence or a negative surgical margin rate between the two groups (p value = 0.409 and p value = 1.000, respectively). The aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and inflammatory indicators in the LLR group were significantly lower than those in the OLR group on the first and third postoperative days. Additionally, OS and RFS were comparable in both the LLR and OLR groups (p value = 0.700 and p value = 0.780, respectively), and similar results were obtained by conducting a sensitivity analysis.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"">LLR can impart less liver function damage, better inflammatory response attenuation contributing to a faster recovery, and parallel oncologic outcomes when compared with OLR.

The role of CBX1 in pan-cancer and its mechanism in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), however, remains to be further investigated.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Bioinformatics approaches were harnessed to scrutinize CBX1's expression profile, its association with tumor staging, and its potential impact on patient outcomes across various cancers. Single-cell RNA sequencing data facilitated the investigation of CBX1 expression patterns at the individual cell level. The CBX1 expression levels in HCC and adjacent non-tumor tissues were quantified through Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), Western Blotting (WB), and Immunohistochemical analyses. A tissue microarray was employed to explore the relationship between CBX1 levels, patient prognosis, and clinicopathological characteristics in HCC. Various in vitro assays-including CCK-8, colony formation, Transwell invasion, and scratch tests-were conducted to assess the proliferative and motility properties of HCC cells upon modulation of CBX1 expression. Moreover, the functional impact of CBX1 on HCC was further discerned through xenograft studies in nude mice.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">CBX1 was found to be upregulated in most cancer forms, with heightened expression correlating with adverse patient prognoses. Within the context of HCC, elevated levels of CBX1 were consistently indicative of poorer clinical outcomes. Suppression of CBX1 through knockdown methodologies markedly diminished HCC cell proliferation, invasive capabilities, migratory activity, Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) processes, and resistance to Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Contrastingly, CBX1 augmentation facilitated the opposite effects. Subsequent investigative efforts revealed CBX1 to be a promoter of EMT and a contributor to increased TKI resistance within HCC cells, mediated via the IGF-1R/AKT/SNAIL signaling axis. The oncogenic activities of CBX1 proved to be attenuable either by AKT pathway inhibition or by targeted silencing of IGF-1R.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">The broad overexpression of CBX1 in pan-cancer and specifically in HCC positions it as a putative oncogenic entity.

1,"Liver functional assessment using time-associated change in the liver-to-spleen signal intensity ratio on enhanced magnetic resonance imaging: a retrospective study. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND"" NlmCategory=""BACKGROUND"">Liver-to-spleen signal intensity ratio (LSR) is evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the hepatobiliary phase and has been reported as a useful radiological assessment of regional liver function. However, LSR is a passive (non-time-associated) assessment of liver function, not a dynamic (time-associated) assessment. Moreover, LSR shows limitations such as a dose bias of contrast medium and a timing bias of imaging. Previous studies have reported the advantages of time-associated liver functional assessment as a precise assessment of liver function. For instance, the indocyanine green (ICG) disappearance rate, which is calculated from serum ICG concentrations at multiple time points, reflects a precise preoperative liver function for predicting post-hepatectomy liver failure without the dose bias of ICG or the timing bias of blood sampling. The aim of this study was to develop a novel time-associated radiological liver functional assessment and verify its correlation with traditional liver functional parameters.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">A total of 279 pancreatic cancer patients were evaluated to clarify fundamental time-associated changes to LSR in normal liver. We defined the time-associated radiological assessment of liver function, calculated using information on LSR from four time points, as the ""LSR increasing rate"" (LSRi). We then investigated correlations between LSRi and previous liver functional parameters. Furthermore, we evaluated how timing bias and protocol bias affect LSRi.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Significant correlations were observed between LSRi and previous liver functional parameters such as total bilirubin, Child-Pugh grade, and albumin-bilirubin grade (P &lt; 0.001 each).

1,"Spatial epidemiologic analysis of the liver cancer and gallbladder cancer incidence and its determinants in South Korea. Background There have been reports on regional variation in prevalence of hepatitis B and C, and Clonorchis sinensis (C. sinensis) infection, which indicates potential of spatial variation in liver cancer and gallbladder cancer incidence in Korea. Therefore, we aimed to assess the regional variation of liver and gallbladder cancer incidence and its determinants based on the regional distribution of risk factors, including hepatitis B infection in Korea. Methods This study used an ecological study design and district-level cancer incidence statistics generated by the National Cancer Center. Spatial clusters of liver and gallbladder cancer incidence were detected based on spatial scan statistics using SaTScan™ software. We set the size of maximum spatial scanning window of 25 and 35% of the population at risk for analyses of liver and gallbladder cancer, respectively. Significance level of 0.05 was used to reject the null hypothesis of no cluster. We fitted the Besag-York-Mollie model using integrated nested Laplace approximations to assess factors that influence the regional variation in cancer incidence. Results Spatial clusters with high liver cancer incidence rates were detected in the southwestern and southeastern regions of Korea. High gallbladder cancer incidence rates are clustered in the southeastern region. Regional liver cancer incidence can be accounted for the prevalence of high household income (coefficient, - 0.10; 95% credible interval [CI], - 0.18 to - 0.02), marital status (coefficient, - 0.14; 95% CI, - 0.25 to - 0.03), the incidence of hepatitis B (coefficient, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.29 to 1.44), and liver cancer screening (coefficient, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.12), while gallbladder cancer incidence was related to the prevalence of high household income (coefficient, - 0.03; 95% CI, - 0.05 to 0.00) and living close to a river with a high prevalence of liver fluke infection (coefficient, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.96). Conclusions This study demonstrated geographic variation in liver and gallbladder cancer incidence, which can be explained by determinants such as hepatitis B, income, marital status, and living near a river."

Silencing of CEBPA-DT inhibited the growth, migration and invasion of hepatoma cells in vitro and in vivo, while enhancement of CEBPA-DT played a contrasting role. Mechanistic investigations demonstrated that CEBPA-DT could bind to heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C (hnRNPC), which facilitated cytoplasmic translocation of hnRNPC, enhanced the interaction between hnRNPC and DDR2 mRNA, subsequently promoted the expression of DDR2. Meanwhile, CEBPA-DT induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process through upregulation of Snail1 via facilitating nuclear translocation of β-catenin. Using DDR2 inhibitor, we revealed that the CEBPA-DT induced the interaction between DDR2 and β-catenin, thus promoting the nuclear translocation of β-catenin to activate transcription of Snail1, contributing to EMT and HCC metastasis.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our results suggested that CEBPA-DT promoted HCC metastasis through DDR2/β-catenin mediated activation of Snail1 via interaction with hnRNPC, indicating that the CEBPA-DT-hnRNPC-DDR2/β-catenin axis may be used as a potential therapeutic target for HCC treatment.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2022.

1,"Laparoscopic and Open Liver Resections for Colorectal Cancer Liver Metastasis in the Ukrainian State Center. Background Minimally invasive liver resections for metastatic colorectal cancer have been increasingly performed all over the world with promising results. We planned the current study to review our experience on this matter and compare short- and long-term outcomes of laparoscopic liver resection (LLR) and open liver resection (OLR) in patients with colorectal cancer liver metastasis (CRLM). Materials and methods This is a single-center retrospective analysis of patients with CRLM who underwent laparoscopic (n=86) and open (n=96) surgical treatment for metastatic liver lesions between March 2016 and November 2022. Tumor characteristics, intra- and postoperative results, overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed and compared. Results LLR was associated with significantly shorter surgery duration (180 minutes versus 295 minutes, p=0.03). There was no significant difference in blood loss between the two groups (100 mL versus 350 mL, p=0.061). Additionally, the laparoscopic approach was associated with significantly shorter hospital stays (6 days versus 9 days, p=0.004). The rate of major complications (Clavien-Dindo classification ≥ 3) was lower in the LLR group (5.8% versus 16.6%, p=0.037). There was no mortality in the LLR group, and in the OLR group, one lethal case was induced by mesenteric thrombosis on the fifth postoperative day. We did not find a statistically significant difference in the OS rate between the two groups at one, three, and five years: 97.3%, 74.7%, and 43.4%, respectively, in the OLR group and 95.1%, 70.3%, and 49.5%, respectively, in the LLR group (p=0.53). DFS at one, three, and five years were 88.7%, 52.3%, and 25.5%, respectively, in the LLR group and 71.9%, 53.1%, and 19.3%, respectively, in the OLR group (p=0.66). Conclusions This study showed that laparoscopic liver surgery is a safe and effective method of CRLM treatment in our center. LLR was associated with a decrease in major morbidity, shorter surgery duration, and reduced postoperative hospital stay. Minimally invasive liver resections showed similar oncological outcomes to the open approach in terms of overall and disease-free survival."

1,"Promising practices for the prevention of liver cancer: a review of the literature and cancer plan activities in the National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma, a type of primary liver cancer, and are most prevalent in people born 1945–1965. Relatively little information is available for liver cancer prevention, compared to other cancers. In this review, we provide a summary of current promising public health practices for liver cancer prevention from the literature, as well as liver cancer-related initiatives in the National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program (NCCCP). Two types of source materials were analyzed for this review: published literature (2005-present), and current cancer plans from the NCCCP (2005–2022). A search strategy was developed to include a review of several scientific databases. Of the 73 articles identified as potentially eligible, 20 articles were eligible for inclusion in the review. Eligible articles were abstracted using a data abstraction tool. Three independent keyword searches on 65 NCCCP plans were conducted. Keyword searches within each of the plans to identify activities related to liver cancer were conducted. Relevant information was abstracted from the plans and saved in a data table. Of the 20 eligible articles, 15 articles provided information on interventions related to liver cancer and hepatitis B or hepatitis C prevention. All 15 of the intervention articles were related to hepatitis; 13 were hepatitis B-focused, two were hepatitis C-focused, and 14 focused on Asian/Pacific Islander American populations. The independent keyword search of NCCCP plans produced 46 results for liver, 27 results for hepatitis, and 52 results for alcohol. Two plans included activities related to liver cancer. Twenty-four plans included activities related to hepatitis. A majority of the intervention articles published focused on HBV infection in Asian/Pacific Islander American populations, and a small percentage of NCCCP plans included liver-related content. The findings from this review will inform the development of an Action Plan on liver cancer prevention for the NCCCP, which will assist programs with the adoption and uptake of promising practices for the prevention of liver cancer."

1,"Risk factors, prognostic factors, and nomograms for liver metastasis in stage Tis-T2 colorectal cancer patients from a population-based study. Liver metastasis(LM) is the primary cause of mortality in patients with colorectal cancer. The incidence of liver metastasis in patients with stage T<sub>is</sub>-T<sub>2</sub> colorectal cancer is uncommon, and there is limited research available. While nomograms have been increasingly utilized in oncology, there is a lack of studies focusing on the diagnosis and prognostic assessment of liver metastasis in patients with stage T<sub>is</sub>-T<sub>2</sub> colorectal cancer. The data of patients with stage T<sub>is</sub>-T<sub>2</sub> colorectal cancer diagnosed between 2010 and 2015 were extracted from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the independent risk factors for liver metastasis in patients with stage T<sub>is</sub>-T<sub>2</sub> colorectal cancer. Additionally, both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to determine the independent prognostic factors in patients with stage T<sub>is</sub>-T<sub>2</sub> colorectal cancer who had liver metastasis. Subsequently, two nomograms were developed and the results were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). A total of 11,116 patients diagnosed with stage T<sub>is</sub>-T<sub>2</sub> colorectal cancer were studied, among whom 190 (1.71%) developed liver metastasis. The identified independent risk factors for liver metastasis in these patients included age, sex, primary tumor size, serum CEA levels, N stage, and histological type. Furthermore, sex, race, primary tumor size, serum CEA levels, and chemotherapy were found to be independent factors influencing the prognosis of patients with stage T<sub>is</sub>-T<sub>2</sub> colorectal cancer who developed liver metastasis. The accuracy of predicting the risk and prognosis of liver metastasis in these patients was confirmed through various analyses such as ROC curves, calibration curves, DCA curves, and Kaplan-Meier survival curves on both training and validation sets using two nomograms. The two nomograms are considered effective tools for predicting the risk of liver metastasis in patients with stage T<sub>is</sub>-T<sub>2</sub> colorectal cancer, as well as predicting the prognosis of patients with liver metastasis. These tools can aid in clinical decision-making."

1,"Prospective study of early detection for primary liver cancer. Purpose: To determine whether repeated screening can lead to early detection of primary liver cancer (PLC) and in turn to an improved clinical result.Methods: In this randomized controlled study, Shanghai urban residents aged 35–55 years and with serum evidence of HBV infection or chronic liver disease were eligible for recruitment. Using cluster sampling, these subjects were allocated into two groups — the screening group and the control group: there were 8109 subjects in the screening group and 9711 in the control group. Subjects in the screening group were tested with serum AFP and real-time ultrasound every 6 months. One to four rounds of screening were completed. Liver cancer was treated according to stage at diagnosis.Results: All subjects enrolled were followed up and classed at the end-point as alive without liver cancer, alive with liver cancer, dead from liver cancer, or dead from another cause. The mean follow-up was 1.2 years; total followup was 12,038 person-years in the screening group and 9,573 person-years in the control group. We detected 38 patients with PLC in the screening group and 18 patients with PLC in the control group. In the patients in the screening group 76.8% of patients were at a subclinical stage, and 70.6% of them underwent resection, the 1- and 2-year survival rates being 88.1% and 77.5%, respectively. However, in the control group, none of the patients was at a subclinical stage when diagnosed, none of them underwent resection, and none of them survived over 1 year. The lead time was estimated at 0.45 years. The cost of detecting PLC at an early stage was RMB 12,600 (US$ 1,500).Conclusion: The study proved that screening the high-risk population for PLC with a serum AFP test and real-time ultrasound examination can detect patients in the early stages, increase the resection rate and prolong the survival time. It is therefore recommended that screening for PLC be advocated in any high-risk area."
1,"Blocking and reversing hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B treated by traditional Chinese medicine (tablets of biejia ruangan or RGT): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial. Background: Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) can progress to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and ultimately liver-related death. Although oral antiviral therapy for patients with CHB reduces the risk of such complications, once cirrhosis is established, the benefits of antiviral therapy are not robustly demonstrated. According to traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), some Chinese herbal medicines promote blood circulation and soften hard masses, and therefore they may block and reverse hepatic fibrosis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of TCM tablets of the compound biejia ruangan (RGT) administered for fibrosis, and entecavir (ETV), on the development of HCC in patients with CHB or hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related compensated cirrhosis. Methods/design: This multicenter, centrally randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study is planned to complete within 5 years. For the study, 1,000 with CHB or HBV-related compensated cirrhosis are randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to a treatment group (0.5 mg ETV once daily; 2 g RGT three times daily) or a control group (0.5 mg ETV once daily; 2 g RGT dummy agent three times daily). The primary end points are the development of HCC and liver-related death. Secondary end points include disease progression and overall survival. Discussion: Although antiviral therapy can achieve sustained suppression of HBV replication, thereby preventing cirrhosis, patients with CHB treated with nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs) retain a higher risk for HCC compared with patients with inactive disease. Although previous clinical trials with RGT have confirmed the efficacy of blocking and reversing hepatic fibrosis in patients with CHB or compensated cirrhosis, the long-term risk for HCC or disease progression in these patients treated with combination of RGT and NUCs compared with NUCs alone is unclear. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the effects of the RGT blockade and reversal of hepatic fibrosis on the development of HCC in patients with CHB or HBV-related compensated cirrhosis in large, prospective, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, controlled trials in China."

The biological role of cNFIB was determined in vitro and in vivo by gain or loss of functional experiments. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) and RNA pull-down assays were conducted to analyze the interaction of cNFIB with dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase1 (MEK1). Duolink in situ proximity ligation assay (PLA) and coimmunoprecipitation (co-IP) assay were used to investigate the effects of cNFIB on the interaction between MEK1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase 2 (ERK2). Finally, a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed to explore the influences of cNFIB on the anti-tumor activity of trametinib (a MEK inhibitor).</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"">cNFIB was significantly down-regulated in human ICC tissues with postoperative metastases. The loss of cNFIB was highly associated with aggressive characteristics and predicted unfavorable prognosis in ICC patients. Functional studies revealed that cNFIB inhibited the proliferation and metastasis of ICC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, cNFIB competitively interacted with MEK1, which induced the dissociation between MEK1 and ERK2, thereby resulting in the suppression of ERK signaling and tumor metastasis. Moreover, we found that ICC cells with high levels of cNFIB held the potential to delay the trametinib resistance. Consistently, in vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that cotreatment with trametinib and lentivirus vector encoding cNFIB showed greater inhibitory effect than isolated trametinib treatment.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our findings identified that cNFIB played a key role in ICC growth and metastasis by regulating MEK1/ERK signaling.

1,"Non-hepatic Cancers Independently Predict Liver Decompensation Events Advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis represent independent risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There is also evidence suggesting that several etiologies of chronic liver disease elevate the risk for non-hepatic cancers, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), alcohol abuse, and hepatitis C infection. In the present study, we aim to characterize the cancer incidence in patients with chronic liver disease and assess the prognostic value of non-hepatic cancer on the decompensation events of this population. We retrospectively reviewed the electronic medical records of patients who underwent transient elastography (TE) of liver, at John H. Stroger Hospital in Cook County, Chicago, IL. We identified patients who had decompensation of cirrhosis. We also extracted their cancer history. The cancer profiles of the cohort were compared by the presence or absence of advanced liver fibrosis. We then performed univariate and multivariate forward stepwise Cox regression analysis to identify the significant risk factors for the decompensation events and plotted Kaplan-Meier curve to demonstrate the significance of cancer in the prediction of decompensation events. We identified a total of 3097 patients who underwent TE. A total of 45 liver decompensation events were documented. In the univariate Cox regression model, MELD-Na score (hazard ratio (HR) 1.25, p < 0.001), liver stiffness measurement (HR 1.05, p = 0.004), and history of any cancer (HR 3.81, p = 0.001) emerged as predictors of decompensation. Non-hepatic cancer proved to be a significant predictor of decompensation (HR 3.57, p = 0.002). The present study represents the first attempt to the best of our knowledge to describe the cancer incidence in this high-risk population. We found that non-HCC cancers independently predict hepatic decompensation events, which is an intriguing finding. We propose that physicians should be more vigilant to cancer history of patients with chronic liver disease as it might provide valuable prognostic information and guide individualized treatment and surveillance plans."
1,"Preoperative classification of primary and metastatic liver cancer via machine learning-based ultrasound radiomics. To investigate the application of machine learning–based ultrasound radiomics in preoperative classification of primary and metastatic liver cancer. Data of 114 consecutive histopathologically confirmed patients with liver cancer from January 2018 to November 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. All patients underwent liver ultrasonography within 1 week before hepatectomy or fine-needle biopsy. The liver lesions were manually segmented by two experts using ITK-SNAP software. Seven categories of radiomics features, including first-order, two-dimensional shape, gray-level co-occurrence matrices, gray-level run-length matrix, gray-level size-zone matrix, neighboring gray tone difference matrix, and gray-level dependence matrix, were extracted on the Pyradiomics platform. Fourteen filters were applied to the original images, and derived images were obtained. Then, the dimensions of radiomics features were reduced by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) method. Finally, k-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) were employed to distinguish primary liver cancer from metastatic liver cancer by a fivefold cross-validation strategy. The performance of the established model was mainly evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and accuracy. One thousand four hundred nine radiomics features were extracted from the original images and/or derived images for each patient. The mentioned five machine learning classifiers were able to differentiate primary liver cancer from metastatic liver cancer. LR outperformed other classifiers, with the accuracy of 0.843 ± 0.078 (AUC, 0.816 ± 0.088; sensitivity, 0.768 ± 0.232; specificity, 0.880 ± 0.117). Machine learning–based ultrasound radiomics features are able to non-invasively distinguish primary liver tumors from metastatic liver tumors. • Ultrasound-based radiomics was initially used for preoperative classification of primary versus metastatic liver cancer. • Multiple machine learning–based algorithms with cross-validation strategy were applied to extract machine learning–based ultrasound radiomics features. • Distinction between primary and metastatic tumors was obtained with a sensitivity of 0.768 and a specificity of 0.880."

1,"Matrix stiffness-upregulated LOXL2 promotes fibronectin production, MMP9 and CXCL12 expression and BMDCs recruitment to assist pre-metastatic niche formation. Higher matrix stiffness affects biological behavior of tumor cells, regulates tumor-associated gene/miRNA expression and stemness characteristic, and contributes to tumor invasion and metastasis. However, the linkage between higher matrix stiffness and pre-metastatic niche in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still largely unknown. We comparatively analyzed the expressions of LOX family members in HCC cells grown on different stiffness substrates, and speculated that the secreted LOXL2 may mediate the linkage between higher matrix stiffness and pre-metastatic niche. Subsequently, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanism by which matrix stiffness induced LOXL2 expression in HCC cells, and explored the effects of LOXL2 on pre-metastatic niche formation, such as BMCs recruitment, fibronectin production, MMPs and CXCL12 expression, cell adhesion, etc. Higher matrix stiffness significantly upregulated LOXL2 expression in HCC cells, and activated JNK/c-JUN signaling pathway. Knockdown of integrin β1 and α5 suppressed LOXL2 expression and reversed the activation of above signaling pathway. Additionally, JNK inhibitor attenuated the expressions of p-JNK, p-c-JUN, c-JUN and LOXL2, and shRNA-c-JUN also decreased LOXL2 expression. CM-LV-LOXL2-OE and rhLOXL2 upregulated MMP9 expression and fibronectin production obviously in lung fibroblasts. Moreover, activation of Akt pathway contributed to LOXL2-induced fibronectin upregulation. LOXL2 in CM as chemoattractant increased motility and invasion of BMCs, implicating a significant role of LOXL2 in BMCs recruitment. Except that, CM-LV-LOXL2-OE as chemoattractant also increased the number of migrated HCC cells, and improved chemokine CXCL12 expression in lung fibroblasts. The number of HCC cells adhered to surface of lung fibroblasts treated with CM-LV-LOXL2-OE was remarkably higher than that of the control cells. These results indicated that the secreted LOXL2 facilitated the motility of HCC cells and strengthened CTCs settlement on the remodeled matrix “soil”. Integrin β1/α5/JNK/c-JUN signaling pathway participates in higher matrix stiffness-induced LOXL2 upregulation in HCC cells. The secreted LOXL2 promotes fibronectin production, MMP9 and CXCL12 expression and BMDCs recruitment to assist pre-metastatic niche formation."
1,"Cancer Burden Variations and Convergences in Globalization: A Comparative Study on the Tracheal, Bronchus, and Lung (TBL) and Liver Cancer Burdens Among WHO Regions from 1990 to 2019. Lung cancer and liver cancer are the leading and third causes of cancer death, respectively. Both lung and liver cancer are with clear major risk factors. A thorough understanding of their burdens in the context of globalization, especially the convergences and variations among WHO regions, is useful in precision cancer prevention worldwide and understanding the changing epidemiological trends with the expanding globalization. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) and WHO Global Health Observatory (GHO) database were analyzed to evaluate the burden metrics and risk factors of trachea, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer and liver cancer. Western Pacific Region (WPR) had the highest age-standardized incidence rate (ASIR) for both liver cancer (11.02 [9.62-12.61] per 100,000 population) and TBL cancer (38.82 [33.63-44.04] per 100,000 population) in 2019. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for liver and TBL cancer elevated with the increasing sociodemographic index (SDI) level, except for liver cancer in WPR and TBL cancer in European Region (EUR). Region of the Americas (AMR) showed the biggest upward trends of liver cancer age-standardized rates (ASRs), as well as the biggest downward trends of TBL cancer ASRs, followed by Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR). Alcohol use and smoking were the leading cause of liver and TBL cancer death in most WHO regions. Variances of ASRs for liver and TBL cancer among WHO memberships have been decreasing during the past decade. The homogenization and convergence of cancer burdens were also demonstrated in different agegroups and sexes and in the evolution of associated risk factors and etiology. In conclusion, our study reflects the variations and convergences in the liver and lung cancer burdens among the WHO regions with the developing globalization, which suggests that we need to be acutely aware of the global homogeneity of the disease burden that accompanies increasing globalization, including the global convergences in various populations, risk factors, and burden metrics."

1,"Single-cell analysis uncovers liver susceptibility to pancreatic cancer metastasis via myeloid cell characterization. The liver is the predominant metastatic site for diverse cancers, including pancreatic and colorectal cancers (CRC), etc. The high incidence of hepatic metastasis of pancreatic cancer is an important reason for its refractory and high mortality. Therefore, it is important to understand how metastatic pancreatic cancer affects the hepatic tumor immune microenvironment (TME) in patients. Here, we characterized the TME of liver metastases unique to pancreatic cancer by comparing them with CRC liver metastases. We integrated two single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets including tumor samples of pancreatic cancer liver metastasis (P-LM), colorectal cancer liver metastasis (C-LM), primary pancreatic cancer (PP), primary colorectal cancer (PC), as well as samples of peripheral blood mono-nuclear cells (PBMC), adjacent normal pancreatic tissues (NPT), to better characterize the heterogeneities of the microenvironment of two kinds of liver metastases. We next performed comparative analysis on cellular compositions between P-LM and C-LM, found that Mph_SPP1, a subset of macrophages associated with angiogenesis and tumor invasion, was more enriched in the P-LM group, indicating this kind of macrophages provide a TME niche more vulnerable for pancreatic cancers. Analysis of the developmental trajectory implied that Mph_SPP1 may progressively be furnished with increased expression of genes regulating endothelium. Cell-cell communications analysis revealed that Mph_SPP1 potentially interacts with endothelial cells in P-LM via FN1/SPP1-ITGAV/ITGB1, implying this macrophage subset may construct an immunosuppressive TME for pancreatic cancer by regulating endothelial cells. We also found that Mph_SPP1 has a prognostic value in pancreatic adenocarcinoma that is not present in colon adenocarcinoma or rectum adenocarcinoma. This study provides a new perspective for understanding the characteristics of the hepatic TME in patients with liver metastatic cancer. And it provides a subset of macrophages specifically associated with the liver metastasis of pancreatic cancer, and its detection and intervention have potential value for preventing the metastasis of pancreatic cancer to the liver."
1,"Operative and short-term oncologic outcomes of laparoscopic versus open liver resection for colorectal liver metastases located in the posterosuperior liver: a propensity score matching analysis. Laparoscopic resection (LLR) of colorectal liver metastases (CRLM) located in the posterosuperior liver (segments 4a, 7, and 8) is challenging but has become more practical recently due to progress in operative techniques. We aimed to compare tumor-specific, perioperative, and short-term oncological outcomes after LLR and open liver resection (OLR) for CRLM. Patients who underwent curative resection of CRLM with at least 1 tumor in the posterosuperior liver during 2012–2015 were analyzed. Tumor-specific factors associated with the adoption of LLR were analyzed by logistic regression model. One-to-one propensity score matching was used to match baseline characteristics between patients with LLR and OLR. The original cohort included 30 patients with LLR and 239 with OLR. Median follow-up time was 23.8 months. Logistic regression analysis showed that multiple, diameter ≥30 mm, deep location, and closeness to major vessels were associated with OLR. None of the 24 patients with none or one of these factors were converted from LLR to OLR. After matching, 29 patients with LLR and 29 with OLR were analyzed. The 2 groups had similar preoperative factors. The LLR and OLR groups did not differ with respect to operative time, intraoperative bleeding, incidence of blood transfusion, surgical margin positivity, incidence of postoperative complications, and unplanned readmission within 45 days. Median length of postoperative hospital stay was significantly shorter for LLR versus OLR (4 days [1–12] vs. 5 days [4–18]; p = 0.0003). Median recurrence-free survival was similar for patients who underwent LLR versus OLR (10.6 months for LLR vs. 13.4 months for OLR; p = 0.87). Compared to OLR, LLR of posterosuperior CRLM is associated with significantly shorter postoperative hospital stay but otherwise similar perioperative and short-term oncological outcomes. Tumor-specific factors associated with safe and routine LLR approach despite challenging location are superficial, solitary, and small (<30 mm) CRLM not associated with major vessels."

1,"Complete remission of multiple liver metastases with only partial response of the primary rectal cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Colorectal cancer is commonly diagnosed among the Japanese population, and various strategies in treating the colorectal liver metastasis have been introduced over the years. Here, we present a case of colorectal liver metastases in which we devised a multidisciplinary treatment plan for a better prognosis. We report a case of a 44-year-old female who developed rectal cancer with advanced synchronous liver metastases and was treated by a liver-first surgical approach following neoadjuvant chemotherapy. At diagnosis, there were 12 bilobular lesions in the liver, and the primary rectal cancer was asymptomatic and unprogressive. We adopted a liver-first strategy because the control of the liver metastases was considered the key prognostic factor. Furthermore, because the lesions were highly progressive, we planned neoadjuvant systemic chemotherapy first to provide an observational period to identify potential new metastatic lesions that were refractory to systemic chemotherapy or contraindicative for surgical resection. We administered two courses of S-1 + oxaliplatin (SOX)+ bevacizumab (BV) and an additional course of SOX without BV as neoadjuvant chemotherapy in preparation for surgery. This resulted in a prominent minimalization of colorectal liver metastases, and no other remote metastasis was observed. Then, surgical resection of the colorectal liver metastases was performed safely, and the pathological result revealed complete remission of all tumors by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The primary tumor in the colon was successfully resected 2 months after the hepatectomy. Although the patient experienced a recurrence in two different sites in the lungs 10 months after resection of the primary rectal lesion, these metastases were successfully resected after diagnosis. The patient is alive with no signs of recurrence 3 years after the diagnosis of colorectal cancer with synchronous liver metastases. The combination of a liver-first strategy and neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a possible treatment of choice to cure colorectal cancer with simultaneous advanced colorectal liver metastases."

1,"Laparoscopic hepatectomy enhances recovery for small hepatocellular carcinoma with liver cirrhosis by postoperative inflammatory response attenuation: a propensity score matching analysis with a conventional open approach. The concurrent presence of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) poses a challenge for laparoscopic surgeons to establish a routine practice. The aim of this study was to gather evidence and produce recommendations on the safe and effective practice of laparoscopic hepatectomy for patients with solitary HCC (≤ 5 cm) and liver cirrhosis. Between October 2013 and October 2014, 356 curative hepatectomies were performed for patients pathologically diagnosed with solitary HCC (≤ 5 cm) accompanied by cirrhosis (stage 4 fibrosis). To overcome selection bias, a 1:2 match using propensity score matching analysis was conducted between laparoscopic and open hepatectomy. Perioperative outcomes were compared between the groups, including hospitalization, operation time, blood loss, and surgical complications. Perioperative inflammation-based markers, including systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) were collected from medical records and analyzed. There were 43 and 77 patients in the laparoscopic and open groups, respectively. The laparoscopic group had less hepatic inflow occlusion (16.3% vs. 61%; P < 0.001), shorter operation time (155 vs. 170 min; P = 0.004), and shorter postoperative hospital stay (4 vs. 7 days; P < 0.001). Although the difference was not significant (P = 0.154), the rate of postoperative complications tended to be lower in the laparoscopic group (2.3%) compared with the open group (9.1%). The increase in postoperative SII, NLR, and LMR for laparoscopic hepatectomy were significantly lower than for open hepatectomy. NLR < 5.8 on postoperative day 3 was significantly correlated with shorter hospital stay (P < 0.001). Compared with open hepatectomy, laparoscopic hepatectomy for selected HCC patients, even in the presence of cirrhosis, might result in better perioperative outcomes and postoperative inflammatory response attenuation, and ultimately promote faster recovery. This provides evidence for considering routine laparoscopic hepatectomy through careful selection of patients with HCC."

1,"GRP78 as a regulator of liver steatosis and cancer progression mediated by loss of the tumor suppressor PTEN Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), a molecular chaperone widely elevated in human cancers, is critical for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein folding, stress signaling and PI3K/AKT activation. Genetic knockout models of GRP78 revealed that GRP78 maintains homeostasis of metabolic organs, including liver, pancreas and adipose tissues. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CC) are the most common liver cancers. There is a lack of effective therapeutics for HCC and CC, highlighting the need to further understand liver tumorigenic mechanisms. PTEN (phosphatase and tenson homolog deleted on chromosome 10), a tumor suppressor that antagonizes the PI3K/AKT pathway, is inactivated in a wide range of tumors, including 40-50% of human liver cancers. To elucidate the role of GRP78 in liver cancer, we created a mouse model with biallelic liver-specific deletion of Pten and Grp78 mediated by Albumin-Cre-recombinase (cP(f/f)78(f/f)). Interestingly, in contrast to PTEN, deletion of GRP78 was progressive but incomplete. At 3 months, cP(f/f)78(f/f) livers showed hepatomegaly, activation of lipogenic genes, exacerbated steatosis and liver injury, implying that GRP78 protects the liver against PTEN-null-mediated pathogenesis. Furthermore, in response to liver injury, we observed increased proliferation and expansion of bile duct and liver progenitor cells in cP(f/f)78(f/f) livers. Strikingly, bile duct cells in cP(f/f)78(f/f) livers maintained wild-type (WT) GRP78 level, whereas adjacent areas showed GRP78 reduction. Analysis of signaling pathways revealed selective JNK activation, β-catenin downregulation, along with PDGFRα upregulation, which was unique to cP(f/f)78(f/f) livers at 6 months. Development of both HCC and CC was accelerated and was evident in cP(f/f)78(f/f) livers at 8-9 months, coinciding with intense GRP78 expression in the cancer lesions, and GRP78 expression in adjacent normal areas reverted back to the WT level. In contrast, c78(f/f) livers showed no malignancy even at 14 months. These studies reveal that GRP78 is a novel regulator for PTEN-loss-mediated liver injury and cancer progression."
1,"Lifestyle factors, glycemic traits, and lipoprotein traits and risk of liver cancer: a Mendelian randomization analysis. The current state of knowledge on the relationship between lifestyle factors, glycemic traits, lipoprotein traits with liver cancer risk is still uncertain despite some attempts made by observational studies.

Employing MR analysis, this study utilized previously published GWAS datasets to investigate whether lifestyle factors, glycemic traits, and lipoprotein traits would affect the risk of liver cancer. The study utilized three MR methods, including inverse variance-weighted model (IVW), MR Egger, and weighted median. Furthermore, MR-Egger analyses were performed to detect heterogeneity in the MR results. The study also conducted a leave-one-out analysis to assess the potential influence of individual SNPs on the MR analysis results. MR-PRESSO was used to identify and remove SNP outliers associated with liver cancer. MR analyses revealed that 2-h glucose (odds ratio, OR 2.33, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.28-4.21), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM, OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.18-2.37), body mass index (BMI, OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.18-2.37), waist circumference (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.18-2.37) were associated with increased risk of liver cancer. On the contrary, apolipoproteins B (APOB, OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.47-0.97), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL, OR 0.62, 95% CI 0.42-0.92) were negatively related to liver cancer risk. Additionally, after adjusting for BMI, apolipoproteins A-I (APOA-I, OR 0.56, 95% CI, 0.38-0.81), total cholesterol (TC, OR 0.72, 95% CI, 0.54-0.94), and total triglycerides (TG, OR 0.57, 95% CI, 0.40-0.78) exhibited a significant inverse correlation with the risk of liver cancer. This study supports a causal relationship between 2-h glucose, T2DM, BMI, and waist circumference with the increased risk of liver cancer. Conversely, the study reveals a cause-effect relationship between TC, TG, LDL, APOA-I, and APOB with a decreased risk of liver cancer."
1,"Uridine prevents tamoxifen-induced liver lipid droplet accumulation. Tamoxifen, an agonist of estrogen receptor, is widely prescribed for the prevention and long-term treatment of breast cancer. A side effect of tamoxifen is fatty liver, which increases the risk for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Prevention of tamoxifen-induced fatty liver has the potential to improve the safety of long-term tamoxifen usage. Uridine, a pyrimidine nucleoside with reported protective effects against drug-induced fatty liver, was co-administered with tamoxifen in C57BL/6J mice. Liver lipid levels were evaluated with lipid visualization using coherent anti-Stokes Raman scatting (CARS) microscopy, biochemical assay measurement of triacylglyceride (TAG), and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) measurement of membrane phospholipid. Blood TAG and cholesterol levels were measured. Mitochondrial respiration of primary hepatocytes in the presence of tamoxifen and/or uridine was evaluated by measuring oxygen consumption rate with an extracellular flux analyzer. Liver protein lysine acetylation profiles were evaluated with 1D and 2D Western blots. In addition, the relationship between endogenous uridine levels, fatty liver, and tamoxifen administration was evaluated in transgenic mice UPase1; −/−and UPase1-TG. Uridine co-administration prevented tamoxifen-induced liver lipid droplet accumulation in mice. The most prominent effect of uridine co-administration with tamoxifen was the stimulation of liver membrane phospholipid biosynthesis. Uridine had no protective effect against tamoxifen-induced impairment to mitochondrial respiration of primary hepatocytes or liver TAG and cholesterol export. Uridine had no effect on tamoxifen-induced changes to liver protein acetylation profile. Transgenic mice UPase1; −/−with increased pyrimidine salvage activity were protected against tamoxifen-induced liver lipid droplet accumulation. In contrast, UPase1-TG mice with increased pyrimidine catabolism activity had intrinsic liver lipid droplet accumulation, which was aggravated following tamoxifen administration. Uridine co-administration was effective at preventing tamoxifen-induced liver lipid droplet accumulation. The ability of uridine to prevent tamoxifen-induced fatty liver appeared to depend on the pyrimidine salvage pathway, which promotes biosynthesis of membrane phospholipid."

1,"PD-L1 expression in liver metastasis: its clinical significance and discordance with primary tumor in colorectal cancer The outcomes of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancer patients with liver metastases are poor, which may be related to a different tumor microenvironment in liver metastases from primary tumors. This study was aimed to analyze PD-L1 expression and the immune microenvironment status in liver metastases and compare the differences of PD-L1 expression between primary tumors and liver metastases of colorectal cancer. 74 cases of pathologically confirmed colorectal cancer with liver metastasis underwent resection from our hospital were included. Tissue microarrays were used for the interpretation of PD-L1 expression, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) and CD8 density by immunohistochemistry. We evaluated the disparity between primary tumor and liver metastasis in PD-L1 expression, CD4 and CD8 density and analyzed the factors associated with obvious PD-L1 disparity. The expression of PD-L1 was positively related to the density of CD4 and CD8 in liver metastases. The expression of PD-L1 in liver metastases was higher than in primary tumors in certain subgroups, including patients with concurrent liver metastases (n = 63, p = 0.05), patients receiving concurrent resection of primary and metastatic tumors (n = 56, p = 0.04). The two subgroups generally reflected those without inconsistent external influences, such as treatment and temporal factors, between primary tumors and liver metastases. In these subgroups, the intrinsic differences of microenvironment between primary tumors and liver metastases could be identified. Furthermore, tumor differentiation [moderate vs. poor: OR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.03–0.99, p = 0.05)] were demonstrated to be associated with obvious discordance of PD-L1 expression between primary tumors and liver metastases. The expression of PD-L1 in liver metastases was higher than in primary tumors in subgroups, reflecting intrinsic microenvironment differences between primary and metastatic tumors. Obvious discordance of PD-L1 expression between primary tumor and liver metastasis was significantly related to the tumor differentiation."
1,"Baseline liver steatosis has no impact on liver metastases and overall survival in rectal cancer patients The liver is one of the most frequent sites of metastases in rectal cancer. This study aimed to evaluate how the development of synchronous or metachronous liver metastasis and overall survival are impacted by baseline liver steatosis and chemotherapy-induced liver damage in rectal cancer patients. Patients diagnosed with stage II to IV rectal cancer between 2010 and 2016 in our province with suitable baseline CT scan were included. Data on cancer diagnosis, staging, therapy, outcomes and liver function were collected. CT scans were retrospectively reviewed to assess baseline steatosis (liver density < 48 HU and/or liver-to-spleen ratio < 1.1). Among patients without baseline steatosis and treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, chemotherapy-induced liver damage was defined as steatosis appearance, ≥ 10% liver volume increase, or significant increase in liver function tests. We included 283 stage II to IV rectal cancer patients with suitable CT scan (41% females; mean age 68 ± 14 years). Steatosis was present at baseline in 90 (31.8%) patients, synchronous liver metastasis in 42 (15%) patients and metachronous liver metastasis in 26 (11%); 152 (54%) deaths were registered. The prevalence of synchronous liver metastasis was higher in patients with steatosis (19% vs 13%), while the incidence of metachronous liver metastasis was similar. After correcting for age, sex, stage, and year of diagnosis, steatosis was not associated with metachronous liver metastasis nor with overall survival. In a small analysis of 63 patients without baseline steatosis and treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, chemotherapy-induced liver damage was associated with higher incidence of metachronous liver metastasis and worse survival, results which need to be confirmed by larger studies. Our data suggest that rectal cancer patients with steatosis had a similar occurrence of metastases during follow-up, even if the burden of liver metastases at diagnosis was slightly higher, compatible with chance."

1,"Linc00210 drives Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation and liver tumor progression through CTNNBIP1-dependent manner. Liver tumor initiating cells (TICs) have self-renewal and differentiation properties, accounting for tumor initiation, metastasis and drug resistance. Long noncoding RNAs are involved in many physiological and pathological processes, including tumorigenesis. DNA copy number alterations (CNA) participate in tumor formation and progression, while the CNA of lncRNAs and their roles are largely unknown. LncRNA CNA was determined by microarray analyses, realtime PCR and DNA FISH. Liver TICs were enriched by surface marker CD133 and oncosphere formation. TIC self-renewal was analyzed by oncosphere formation, tumor initiation and propagation. CRISPRi and ASO were used for lncRNA loss of function. RNA pulldown, western blot and double FISH were used to identify the interaction between lncRNA and CTNNBIP1. Using transcriptome microarray analysis, we identified a frequently amplified long noncoding RNA in liver cancer termed linc00210, which was highly expressed in liver cancer and liver TICs. Linc00210 copy number gain is associated with its high expression in liver cancer and liver TICs. Linc00210 promoted self-renewal and tumor initiating capacity of liver TICs through Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Linc00210 interacted with CTNNBIP1 and blocked its inhibitory role in Wnt/β-catenin activation. Linc00210 silencing cells showed enhanced interaction of β-catenin and CTNNBIP1, and impaired interaction of β-catenin and TCF/LEF components. We also confirmed linc00210 copy number gain using primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) samples, and found the correlation between linc00210 CNA and Wnt/β-catenin activation. Of interest, linc00210, CTNNBIP1 and Wnt/β-catenin signaling targeting can efficiently inhibit tumor growth and progression, and liver TIC propagation. With copy-number gain in liver TICs, linc00210 is highly expressed along with liver tumorigenesis. Linc00210 drives the self-renewal and propagation of liver TICs through activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Linc00210 interacts with CTNNBIP1 and blocks the combination between CTNNBIP1 and β-catenin, driving the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Linc00210-CTNNBIP1-Wnt/β-catenin axis can be targeted for liver TIC elimination."
1,"The novel mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 (temsirolimus) induces antiproliferative effects through inhibition of mTOR in Bel-7402 liver cancer cells. Background: Liver cancer is one of the most frequent cancers in the world. Targeted therapy of cancer with specific inhibitors is developing and has shown promising antitumor efficacy. CCI-779 (temsirolimus), a specific inhibitor of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), can block the mTOR signaling pathway. Here, we systematically examined the expression of mTOR and its downstream targets in liver cancer cells and normal liver cells, then investigated inhibitory effects of CCI-779 on mTOR signaling pathway and its role in regulating liver cancer cell growth. Methods: The expression of mTOR and its downstream targets in Bel-7402 liver cancer cells and HL-7702 normal liver cells were examined by western blot. The mTOR specific inhibitor (CCI-779) was used to treat Bel-7402 cells to identify its effects on Bel-7402 cell growth and activity of mTOR signaling pathway in vitro. Cell viability tests were performed after the treatment of CCI-779. Western blot was applied to assess the changes of mTOR pathway and flow cytometry was used to analyze cell cycle of Bel-7402 cells after the treatment of CCI-779. Results: mTOR, p70S6K, S6, and 4EBP1 were overexpressed in Bel-7402 cells compared with HL-7702 cells. Bel-7402 cells were sensitive to CCI-779. The survival rate of the cells treated with CCI-779 over 0.312 μM was significantly different compared with that of control (P< 0.05). CCI-779 inhibited the phosphorylation of mTOR (Ser2448), p70S6K (Thr389), S6 (Ser240/244), and 4EBP1 (Thr37/46) in different grades and the expressions of p70S6K, S6, and 4EBP1. As a result, CCI-779 induced a dose-dependent decrease in cell proliferation, G1/S arrest and damage of cell shape. Conclusions: Taken together, these data showed that CCI-779 can inhibit mTOR signaling and proliferation in Bel7402 liver cancer cells in vitro. It offers a therapeutic intervention through inhibition of mTOR as a potential strategy for liver cancer."
1,"An Analysis of Content in Comprehensive Cancer Control Plans that Address Chronic Hepatitis B and C Virus Infections as Major Risk Factors for Liver Cancer Chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus (HBV and HCV) infections are among the leading causes of preventable death worldwide. Chronic viral hepatitis is the cause of most primary liver cancer, which is the third leading cause of cancer deaths globally and the ninth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. The extent to which comprehensive cancer control (CCC) programs in states, tribal governments and organizations, territories, and Pacific Island jurisdictions address chronic hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C infections as risk factors for liver cancer or recommend interventions for liver cancer prevention in their CCC plans remains unknown. We searched CCC plans for this information using the search tool at http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/ncccp/ to access the content of plans for this information. A combination of key search terms including “liver cancer”, “hepatitis”, “chronic alcohol”, and “alcohol abuse” were used to identify potential content regarding liver cancer risk factors and prevention. Relevant content was abstracted for further review and classification. Of 66 (Although CDC funds 65 programs, one of the Pacific Island Jurisdiction grantees is the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM). This national program supports four FSM states, each of which submits a cancer plan to CDC for a total of 69 plans. During this time period, 66 plans were available on the website.) CCC plans, 27% (n = 18) addressed liver cancer using the above-mentioned search terms. In the 23 plans that addressed HBV and/or HCV, there were 25 goals, objectives, strategies, and outcomes aimed at reducing the incidence or prevalence of HBV and/or HCV infection. While nearly a third of CCC programs identify at least one goal, objective, strategy, outcome, or prevention program to reduce cancer burden in their CCC plans, few plans discuss specific actions needed to reduce the burden of liver cancer."
1,"Irigenin exerts anticancer effects on human liver cancer cells via induction of mitochondrial apoptosis and cell cycle arrest Irigenin has been reported to exhibit remarkable anticancer effects against several human cancers. Nonetheless, the anticancer effects of irigenin against the human liver cancer cells are still largely unexplored. Consistently, this study was designed to evaluate the anticancer effects of irigenin against human liver cancer cells and to unveil the underlying molecular mechanisms. The results showed that irigenin significantly (p < 0.05) inhibited the growth of the human HepG2 and SNU-182 liver cancer cells with an IC50 value of 14 µM. Nonetheless, the cytotoxic effects of irigenin against the normal THLE-2 cells were comparatively lower as evident from the IC50 of 120 μM. The AO/EB and DAPI staining showed that irigenin induces apoptosis in the human liver cancer cells. Annexin V/PI staining assay revealed a significant (p < 0.05) increase in the percentage of apoptotic HepG2 and SNU-182 liver cancer cells upon treatment with irigenin. It was found that the number of apoptotic HepG2 and SNU-182 cells enhanced from 2.3 to 41.75% and 1.16 to 51.9% at IC50, respectively. Western blot showed a considerable increase in Bax and decrease in the Bcl-2 expression upon irigenin treatment further confirming the induction of apoptosis. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that irigenin also induces G2/M cell cycle arrest of HepG2 and SNU-182 cells. The percentage of G2/M phase HepG2 and SNU-182 cells increased from 17.92 to 34.35% and 23.97 to 38.23% at IC50, respectively This was also accompanied by decrease in the expression of CDK1 and Cyclin-B in HepG2 and SNU-182 cells. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that irigenin inhibits the growth of the human liver cancer cells via induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. These results point towards the potential of irigenin as a lead for the development of chemotherapy for liver cancer."
1,"Evaluation of YO-PRO-1 as an early marker of apoptosis following radiofrequency ablation of colon cancer liver metastases Radiofrequency (RF) ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive treatment for colorectal-cancer liver metastases (CLM) in selected nonsurgical patients. Unlike surgical resection, RFA is not followed by routine pathological examination of the target tumor and the surrounding liver tissue. The aim of this study was the evaluation of apoptotic events after RFA. Specifically, we evaluated YO-PRO-1 (YP1), a green fluorescent DNA marker for cells with compromised plasma membrane, as a potential, early marker of cell death. YP1 was applied on liver tissue adherent on the RF electrode used for CLM ablation, as well as on biopsy samples from the center and the margin of the ablation zone as depicted by dynamic CT immediately after RFA. Normal pig and mouse liver tissues were used for comparison. The same samples were also immunostained for fragmented DNA (TUNEL assay) and for active mitochondria (anti-OxPhos antibody). YP1 was also used simultaneously with propidium iodine (PI) to stain mouse liver and samples from ablated CLM. Following RFA of human CLM, more than 90 % of cells were positive for YP1. In nonablated, dissected pig and mouse liver however, we found similar YP1 signals (93.1 % and 65 %, respectively). In samples of intact mouse liver parenchyma, there was a significantly smaller proportion of YP1 positive cells (22.7 %). YP1 and PI staining was similar for ablated CLM. However in dissected normal mouse liver there was initial YP1 positivity and complete absence of the PI signal and only later there was PI signal. Conclusion: This is the first time that YP1 was applied in liver parenchymal tissue (rather than cell culture). The results suggest that YP1 is a very sensitive marker of early cellular events reflecting an early and widespread plasma membrane injury that allows YP1 penetration into the cells."
1,"IDEAL-IQ in an oncologic population: meeting the challenge of concomitant liver fat and liver iron. Cancer patients often have a history of chemotherapy, putting them at increased risk of liver toxicity and pancytopenia, leading to elevated liver fat and elevated liver iron respectively. T1-in-and-out-of-phase, the conventional MR technique for liver fat assessment, fails to detect elevated liver fat in the presence of concomitantly elevated liver iron. IDEAL-IQ is a more recently introduced MR fat quantification method that corrects for multiple confounding factors, including elevated liver iron. This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board with a waiver for informed consent. We reviewed the MRI studies of 50 cancer patients (30 males, 20 females, 50–78 years old) whose exams included (1) T1-in-and-out-of-phase, (2) IDEAL-IQ, and (3) T2* mapping. Two readers independently assessed fat and iron content from conventional and IDEAL-IQ MR methods. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was estimated to evaluate agreement between conventional MRI and IDEAL-IQ in measuring R2* level (a surrogate for iron level), and in measuring fat level. Agreement between the two readers was also assessed. Wilcoxon signed rank test was employed to compare iron level and fat fraction between conventional MRI and IDEAL-IQ. Twenty percent of patients had both elevated liver iron and moderate/severe hepatic steatosis. Across all patients, there was high agreement between readers for IDEAL-IQ fat fraction (ICC = 0.957) and IDEAL R2* (ICC = 0.971) measurements, but lower agreement for conventional fat fraction measurements (ICC = 0.626). The fat fractions calculated with IOP were statistically significantly different from those calculated with IDEAL-IQ (reader 1: p < 0.001, reader 2: p < 0.001). Fat measurements using IDEAL-IQ and IOP diverged in patients with concomitantly elevated liver fat and liver iron. Given prior work validating IDEAL-IQ, these diverging measurements indicate that IOP is inadequate to screen for hepatic steatosis in our cancer population."
1,"Adjuvant Transarterial chemoembolization does not influence recurrence-free or overall survival in patients with combined hepatocellular carcinoma and Cholangiocarcinoma after curative resection: a propensity score matching analysis The prognosis of patients with combined hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (CHC) is usually poor, and effective adjuvant therapy is missing making it important to investigate whether these patients may benefit from adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). We aimed to evaluate the efficiency of adjuvant TACE for long-term recurrence and survival after curative resection before and after propensity score matching (PSM) analysis. In this retrospective study, of 230 patients who underwent resection for CHC between January 1994 and December 2014, 46 (18.0%) patients received adjuvant TACE. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify the independent predictive factors of survival. Cox regression analyses and log-rank tests were used to compare overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) between patients who did or did not receive adjuvant TACE. A total of 230 patients (mean age 52.2 ± 11.9 years; 172 men) were enrolled, and 46 (mean age 52.7 ± 11.1 years; 38 men) patients received TACE. Before PSM, in multivariate regression analysis, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT), tumour nodularity, macrovascular invasion (MVI), lymphoid metastasis, and extrahepatic metastasis were associated with OS. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), MVI, lymphoid metastasis, and preventive TACE (HR: 2.763, 95% CI: 1.769–4.314, p < 0.001) were independent prognostic factors for DFS. PSM created 46 pairs of patients. Before PSM, adjuvant preventive TACE was not associated with an increased risk of OS (HR: 0.911, 95% CI: 0.545–1.520, p = 0.720) or DFS (HR: 3.345, 95% CI: 1.686–6.638, p = 0.001). After PSM, the 5-year OS and DFS rates were comparable in the TACE group and the non-TACE group (OS: 22.7% vs 14.9%, respectively, p = 0.75; DFS: 11.2% vs 14.4%, respectively, p = 0.06). The present study identified that adjuvant preventive TACE did not influence DFS or OS after curative resection of CHC."

1,"Liver cancer incidence in Saudi Arabia (2001-2020): decreasing trend. Liver cancer is a leading cause of cancer mortality and morbidity worldwide. Existing data on the liver cancer burden in Saudi Arabia are limited. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze liver cancer incidence and mortality trends in Saudi Arabia over two decades (2001-2020) and to compare them with the regional and worldwide data. Liver cancer incidence data in Saudi Arabia were collected from the national cancer registry reports for the study period (2001 to 2020). Additionally, global and regional data on liver cancer burden were obtained from the World Health Organization (WHO); the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC); and the Global Cancer Observatory website. Saudi Arabia revealed a relatively lower burden of liver cancer compared to global rates. Males showed a decreasing trend in age-standardized incidence rates during the study period, while females displayed steady rates. In 2020, liver cancer incidence in males was nearly doubled compared to females with a male-to-female ratio of 1.8:1. Additionally, significant regional variations in the incidence of liver cancer were observed across the administrative regions in Saudi Arabia. Liver cancer ranked first as a cause of cancer death in Saudi Arabia for the year 2020. This trend extends to the broader Gulf Cooperation Council region that includes Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain and United Arab Emirates; with Saudi Arabia experiencing the highest liver cancer mortality rate (5.1 per 100,000 people). In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of gender- and region-specific analysis of liver cancer in Saudi Arabia. While the decline of liver cancer incidence in males is promising, further investigations are needed to understand the underlying causes and maintain observance. The high national mortality rate from liver cancer underscores the need for improved prevention, early detection, and management strategies."
1,"An invasive zone in human liver cancer identified by Stereo-seq promotes hepatocyte-tumor cell crosstalk, local immunosuppression and tumor progression. Dissecting and understanding the cancer ecosystem, especially that around the tumor margins, which have strong implications for tumor cell infiltration and invasion, are essential for exploring the mechanisms of tumor metastasis and developing effective new treatments. Using a novel tumor border scanning and digitization model enabled by nanoscale resolution-SpaTial Enhanced REsolution Omics-sequencing (Stereo-seq), we identified a 500 µm-wide zone centered around the tumor border in patients with liver cancer, referred to as ""the invasive zone"". We detected strong immunosuppression, metabolic reprogramming, and severely damaged hepatocytes in this zone. We also identified a subpopulation of damaged hepatocytes with increased expression of serum amyloid A1 and A2 (referred to collectively as SAAs) located close to the border on the paratumor side. Overexpression of CXCL6 in adjacent malignant cells could induce activation of the JAK-STAT3 pathway in nearby hepatocytes, which subsequently caused SAAs' overexpression in these hepatocytes. Furthermore, overexpression and secretion of SAAs by hepatocytes in the invasive zone could lead to the recruitment of macrophages and M2 polarization, further promoting local immunosuppression, potentially resulting in tumor progression. Clinical association analysis in additional five independent cohorts of patients with primary and secondary liver cancer (n = 423) showed that patients with overexpression of SAAs in the invasive zone had a worse prognosis. Further in vivo experiments using mouse liver tumor models in situ confirmed that the knockdown of genes encoding SAAs in hepatocytes decreased macrophage accumulation around the tumor border and delayed tumor growth. The identification and characterization of a novel invasive zone in human cancer patients not only add an important layer of understanding regarding the mechanisms of tumor invasion and metastasis, but may also pave the way for developing novel therapeutic strategies for advanced liver cancer and other solid tumors."

1,"Application of Serum Annexin A3 in Diagnosis, Outcome Prediction and Therapeutic Response Evaluation for Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma. Annexin A3 (ANXA3) could induce progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via promoting stem cell traits of CD133-positive cells. Moreover, serum ANXA3 showed preliminary diagnostic potential, however further validation was required. Meanwhile, the prognostic value of ANXA3 remained elusive. The present study aimed to validate diagnostic performance and further systematically investigate the prognostic value of serum ANXA3. Serum ANXA3 of 368 HCC patients was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); 295 of these patients underwent resection and 73 underwent transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). Diagnostic performance of ANXA3 was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, and the prognostic value was evaluated by Cox regression and Kaplan–Meier analysis. To evaluate the relationship between serum ANXA3 and circulating CD133 mRNA-positive tumor cells (CD133mRNA+ CTCs), real-time polymerase chain reaction was conducted in 69 patients who underwent resection. Serum ANXA3 provided greater diagnostic performance than α-fetoprotein (area under the curve [AUC] 0.869 vs. 0.782), especially in early diagnosis (AUC 0.852 vs. 0.757) and discriminating HCC from patients at risk (0.832 vs. 0.736). Pretreatment ANXA3 was an independent predictor of tumor recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] 1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.26–2.76, p = 0.002)/progression (HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.04–3.43, p = 0.038) and survival (resectable: HR 2.26, 95% CI 1.44–3.56, p = 0.001; unresectable: HR 2.08, 95% CI 1.10–4.05, p = 0.025), and retained its performance in low-recurrence-risk subgroups. Specifically, dynamic changes of ANXA3-positive status was associated with worse prognosis. ANXA3 was positively correlated with CD133mRNA+ CTCs (r = 0.601, p < 0.001). In patients with detectable CD133mRNA+ CTC, high ANXA3 was positively associated with a higher risk of recurrence and shorter overall survival. Serum ANXA3 shows promise as a biomarker for diagnosis, outcome prediction, and therapeutic response evaluation in patients with HCC."
1,"Microvascular invasion has limited clinical values in hepatocellular carcinoma patients at Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stages 0 or B Microvascular invasion (MVI) is recognized as a prognostic factor associated with poor outcome in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients after curative resection. It remains unclear, however, whether MVI can provide prognostic information for patients at a specific tumor stage. Consecutive HCC patients who underwent curative resection in years of 2007 and 2008 (discovery cohort) were enrolled in this retrospective study. Patients were stratified by the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system. The prognostic significance of MVI for overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) was studied in each subgroup. The clinical significance of MVI was validated in another cohort of patients underwent curative surgery in the year of 2006 (validation cohort). Of the 1540 patients in the discovery cohort, 389 (25.3%) patients had detectable MVI. Occurrence rates of MVI in the BCLC stage 0, A, and B subgroups were 12.4, 26.2, and 34.4%, respectively. In univariate analysis, MVI was associated with poor OS and RFS (P < 0.001 for both) in HCC patients at stage A, with poor OS in patients at stage 0 (P = 0.028), and with poor RFS at stage B (P = 0.039). In multivariate analysis, MVI was an independent risk factor for OS (HR = 1.431, 95% CI, 1.163–1.761, P < 0.001) and RFS (HR = 1.400, 95% CI, 1.150–1.705, P = 0.001) in patients at stage A; and an independent risk factor for RFS (P = 0.043) in patients at stage B. A similar clinical significance of MVI was found in the validation cohort. MVI has limited prognostic value for HCC patients at BCLC stages 0 and B. For those at stage A, MVI was associated with patient survival and may help to select patients with high risk of disease recurrence."
1,"The histological growth pattern of colorectal cancer liver metastases has prognostic value Little is known about the biological characteristics that determine the prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) liver metastases. In previous work we reported three different histological patterns of the tumour-liver interface of CRC liver metastases, termed the pushing, replacement and desmoplastic growth pattern (GP). The purpose of this study was to confirm differences in angiogenic and hypoxic properties of CRC liver metastases with different GPs in a large data set and to study the value of the GP as a prognostic factor. In 205 patients undergoing a resection of CRC liver metastases, the GP of the metastasis was determined using haematoxylin-eosin and Gordon Sweet’s silver staining. The tumour cell proliferation fraction (TCP%), endothelial cell proliferation fraction (ECP%) and carbonic anhydrase 9 (CA9) expression were determined using immunohistochemistry. Standard clinicopathological data and overall survival were recorded. 27.8, 15.6, 34.6 and 17.6 % of liver metastases had a replacement, pushing, desmoplastic and mixed GP, respectively. Analyses of TCP%, ECP% and CA9 expression demonstrated that CRC liver metastases with a replacement GP are non-angiogenic, while the ones with a pushing GP are the most angiogenic with angiogenesis being, at least partially, hypoxia-driven. GP (pushing or not) was the only independent predictor of survival at 2 years. CRC liver metastases grow according to different GP patterns with different angiogenic properties. At 2 years of follow-up a GP with a pushing component was an independent predictor of poor survival, suggesting that the pushing GP is characterized by a more aggressive tumour biology. Further elucidation of the mechanisms and biological pathways involved in and responsible for the differences in GP between CRC liver metastases in different patients might lead to therapeutic agents and strategies taking advantage of this 2 year ‘window of opportunity’."

1,"TGF-β signaling alters the pattern of liver tumorigenesis induced by Pten inactivation. Hepatocarcinogenesis results from the accumulation of genetic and epigenetic changes in liver cells. A common mechanism through which these alterations induce liver cancer is by deregulating signaling pathways. A number of signaling pathways, including the PI3K/PTEN/AKT and transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) pathways have been implicated in normal liver development as well as in cancer formation. In this study, we assessed the effect of the TGF-β signaling pathway on liver tumors induced by phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten) loss. Inactivation of only the TGF-β receptor type II, Tgfbr2, in the mouse liver (Tgfbr2(LKO)) had no overt phenotype, while inactivation of Pten alone (Pten(LKO)), resulted in the formation of both hepatocellular carcinomas and cholangiocarcinomas (CC). Interestingly, deletion of both Pten and Tgfbr2 (Pten(LKO);Tgfbr2(LKO)) in the mouse liver resulted in a dramatic shift in tumor type to predominantly CC. Assessment of the PI3K/PTEN/AKT pathway revealed increased phosphorylation of AKT and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β) in both the Pten(LKO) and Pten(LKO);Tgfbr2(LKO) mice, suggesting that this pathway is constitutively active regardless of the status of the TGF-β signaling pathway. However, phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase was observed in the liver of all three phenotypes (Tgfbr2(LKO), Pten(LKO), Pten(LKO);Tgfbr2(LKO)) indicating that the loss of Tgfbr2 and/or Pten leads to an increase in this signaling pathway. Analysis of markers of liver progenitor/stem cells revealed that the loss of TGF-β signaling resulted in increased expression of c-Kit and CD133. Furthermore, in addition to increased c-Kit and CD133, Scf and EpCam expression were also increased in the double knock-out mice. These results suggest that the alteration in tumor types between the Pten(LKO) mice and Pten(LKO);Tgfbr2(LKO) mice is secondary to the altered regulation of stem-cell features induced by the loss of TGF-β signaling."

1,"Down-regulation of sirtuin 3 is associated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma after resection Sirtuin 3 (Sirt3), one of the seven Sirtuins family members, plays critical roles in the progression of multiple cancer types. However, its role in the prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not yet been investigated systematically. The correlation of Sirtuins expression with prognosis of HCC was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in a large HCC patient cohort (n = 342). Expression of Sirt3 in tumoral and peritumoral tissues of HCC patients were further determined by western blotting (WB). IHC and WB studies both showed a decreased expression of Sirt3 in tumoral tissues compared with peritumoral tissues (P = 0.003 for IHC, P = 0.0042 for WB). Decreased expression of Sirt3 in both tumoral and peritumoral tissues was associated with increased recurrence probability and decreased overall survival rate by univariate analyses (intratumoral Sirt3: P = 0.011 for TTR, P = 0.001 for OS; peritumoral Sirt3: P = 0.017 for TTR, P = 0.023 for OS), the prognostic value was strengthened by multivariate analyses (intratumoral Sirt3: P = 0.031 for TTR, P = 0.001 for OS; peritumoral Sirt3: P = 0.047 for TTR, P = 0.031 for OS). Intratumoral Sirt3 also showed a favorable prognostic value in patients with BCLC stage A (TTR, P = 0.011; OS, P < 0.001). In addition, we found that IHC studies of other sirtuin members showed a decreased expression of Sirt2, Sirt4 and Sirt5 and an increased expression of Sirt1, Sirt6 and Sirt7 in intratumoral tissues compared with peritumoral tissues. In contrast to Sirt3, other members did not showed a remarkable correlation with HCC prognosis. Down-regulation of intratumoral and peritumoral Sirt3 were both associated with poor outcome in HCC, moreover, intratumoral Sirt3 was a favorable prognostic predictor in early stage patients."
1,"Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and its receptor hnRNP M are mediators of metastasis and the inflammatory response in the liver. This article discusses the role of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a facilitator of the inflammatory response and its effect on colorectal cancer hepatic metastasis. Colorectal cancer accounts for 11% of all cancers in the United States and the majority of deaths are associated with liver metastasis. If left untreated, median survival is only six to 12 months. Resection of liver metastases offers the only chance for cure. Of the small number of patients who have operable cancer most will have further tumor recurrence. The molecular mechanisms associated with colorectal cancer metastasis to the liver are largely unknown. However CEA production has been shown both clinically and experimentally to be a factor in an increased metastatic potential of colorectal cancers to the liver. CEA also has a role in protecting tumor cells from the effects of anoikis and this affords a selective advantage for tumor cell survival in the circulation. CEA acts in the liver through its interaction with its receptor (CEAR), a protein that is related to the hnRNP M family of RNA binding proteins. In the liver CEA binds with hnRNP M on Kupffer cells and causes activation and production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines including IL-1, IL-10, IL-6 and TNF-α. These cytokines affect the up-regulation of adhesion molecules on the hepatic sinusoidal endothelium and protect the tumor cells against cytotoxicity by nitric oxide (NO) and other reactive oxygen radicals. HnRNP M signaling in Kupffer cells appears to be controlled by beta-adrenergic receptor activation. The cells will respond to the β-adrenergic receptor agonist terbutaline resulting in reduced TNF-α and increased IL-10 and IL-6 production following CEA activation. This has implications for the control of tumor cell implantation and survival in the liver."

1,"Arsenic trioxide augments immunogenic cell death and induces cGAS-STING-IFN pathway activation in hepatocellular carcinoma. The treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is particularly challenging due to the inherent tumoral heterogeneity and easy resistance towards chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Arsenic trioxide (ATO) has emerged as a cytotoxic agent effective for treating solid tumors, including advanced HCC. However, its effectiveness in HCC treatment remains limited, and the underlying mechanisms are still uncertain. Therefore, this study aimed to characterize the effects and mechanisms of ATO in HCC. By evaluating the susceptibilities of human and murine HCC cell lines to ATO treatment, we discovered that HCC cells exhibited a range of sensitivity to ATO treatment, highlighting their inherent heterogeneity. A gene signature comprising 265 genes was identified to distinguish ATO-sensitive from ATO-insensitive cells. According to this signature, HCC patients have also been classified and exhibited differential features of ATO response. Our results showed that ATO treatment induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and the activation of multiple cell death modalities, including necroptosis and ferroptosis, in ATO-sensitive HCC cells. Meanwhile, elevated tumoral immunogenicity was also observed in ATO-sensitive HCC cells. Similar effects were not observed in ATO-insensitive cells. We reported that ATO treatment induced mitochondrial injury and mtDNA release into the cytoplasm in ATO-sensitive HCC tumors. This subsequently activated the cGAS-STING-IFN axis, facilitating CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell infiltration and activation. However, we found that the IFN pathway also induced tumoral PD-L1 expression, potentially antagonizing ATO-mediated immune attack. Additional anti-PD1 therapy promoted the anti-tumor response of ATO in ATO-sensitive HCC tumors. In summary, our data indicate that heterogeneous ATO responses exist in HCC tumors, and ATO treatment significantly induces immunogenic cell death (ICD) and activates the tumor-derived mtDNA-STING-IFN axis. These findings may offer a new perspective on the clinical treatment of HCC and warrant further study."

The locked model was blindly tested in an independent cohort of 846 participants, encompassing both inpatient and outpatient settings across five hospitals.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">In the validation cohort, GutSeer achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.950 [95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.937-0.962] for cancer detection, with 82.8% sensitivity (95% CI: 79.5-86.0) and 95.8% specificity (95% CI: 94.3-97.2). It detected 92.2% of colorectal, 75.5% of esophageal, 65.3% of gastric, 92.9% of liver, and 88.6% of pancreatic cancers. The independent test cohort included 198 early-stage cancers (stage I/II, 66.4%) and 63 advanced precancerous lesions. GutSeer maintained robust performance, with 81.5% sensitivity (95% CI: 77.1-85.9) for GI cancers and 94.4% specificity (95% CI: 92.4-96.5).

The valuable prognostic liver-function-based indicators were selected using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to build a novel liver-function-indicators-based signature (LFIS). Concordance index (C-index), the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), and Kaplan-Meier survival curves were utilized to access the predictive performance of LFIS.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">A total of 434 HCC patients who received anti-PD-1 treatment were included in the study. The LFIS, based on alkaline phosphatase-to-albumin ratio index, Child-Pugh score, platelet-albumin score, aspartate aminotransferase-to-lymphocyte ratio index, and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase-to-lymphocyte ratio index, was constructed and identified as an independent risk factor for patient survival. The C-index of LFIS for overall survival (OS) was 0.692, which was higher than the other single liver-function-based indicator. The AUC of LFIS at 6-, 12-, 18-, and 24-month were 0.74, 0.714, 0.747, and 0.865 for OS, respectively. Patients in the higher-risk LFIS group were associated with both worse OS and PFS.

Functionally, we determined the effects of KSR2 on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of HCC cells through colony formation assays, scratch assays, transwell migration assays, and xenograft tumor models. Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments were used to assess the interaction of phospho-serine binding protein 14-3-3ζ and KSR2, and the effects of this interaction on growth and proliferation of human HCC cells were tested by co-overexpression and knockdown experiments. Additionally, we used flow cytometry to examine whether the KSR2 and 14-3-3ζ interaction conveys HCC resistance to sorafenib.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">KSR2 was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and cell lines, and high KSR2 expression associated with poor prognosis in HCC patients. KSR2 knockdown significantly suppressed HCC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, co-IP experiments identified that 14-3-3ζ complexed with KSR2, and elevated 14-3-3ζ increased KSR2 protein levels in HCC cells. Importantly, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that patients with both high KSR2 and high 14-3-3ζ expression levels had the shortest survival times and poorest prognoses. Interestingly, HCC cells overexpressing both KSR2 and 14-3-3ζ, rather than either protein alone, showed hyperactivated MAPK signaling and resistance to sorafenib.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Our results provide new insights into the pro-tumorigenic role of KSR2 and its regulation of the MAPK pathway in HCC.

1,"Alcohol consumption and liver cancer risk: a meta-analysis Alcohol is a confirmed risk factor of liver cancer. Yet, its dose–response function and synergistic effects with other risk factors remain unclear. We performed a meta-analysis on publications up to May 2014. A total of 112 publications were identified. The meta-relative risk (mRR) and the dose–response trend were calculated. Tests for heterogeneity, publication bias, and sensitivity analyses were performed. The synergy index (SI) was recorded or calculated, whenever possible. Compared to individuals who never drank or drank at very low frequencies, the mRR for ever drinkers was 1.29 (95 % confidence interval, CI 1.16–1.42) and 1.46 (95 % CI 1.27–1.65) for case–control studies, and 1.07 (95 % CI 0.87–1.27) for cohort studies. Being a current drinker was associated with an increased liver cancer risk in case–control studies (mRR = 1.55, 95 % CI 0.38–2.73), but not in cohort studies (mRR = 0.86, 95 % CI 0.74–0.97). The dose–response relation between alcohol and liver cancer was apparent with RR = 1.08 (95 % CI 1.04–1.11) for 12 g/day (~1 drink), 1.54 (95 % CI 1.36–1.74) for 50 g/day, 2.14 (95 % CI 1.74–2.62) for 75 g/day, 3.21 (95 % CI 2.34–4.40) for 100 g/day, and 5.20 (95 % CI 3.25–8.29) for 125 g/day of alcohol consumption. There were synergistic effects of alcohol consumption with hepatitis (S = 2.14, 95 % CI 1.31–2.98) and with diabetes (S = 3.57, 95 % CI 2.29–4.84) on the risk of liver cancer, although this may be subject to publication bias. Overall, one alcoholic drink per day (~12 g/day) may be associated with a 1.1 times higher liver cancer risk. Further studies on the synergistic effects of alcohol consumption and other major risk factors are warranted."

The apoptosis rates of iCCA cell lines were detected by flow cytometry and CCK-8 after co-culturing with CD3/CD28-activated human CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes.

1,"Murine precision-cut liver slices (PCLS): a new tool for studying tumor microenvironments and cell signaling ex vivo. One of the most insidious characteristics of cancer is its spread to and ability to compromise distant organs via the complex process of metastasis. Communication between cancer cells and organ-resident cells via cytokines/chemokines and direct cell-cell contacts are key steps for survival, proliferation and invasion of metastasized cancer cells in organs. Precision-cut liver slices (PCLS) are considered to closely reflect the in vivo situation and are potentially useful for studying the interaction of cancer cells with liver-resident cells as well as being a potentially useful tool for screening anti-cancer reagents. Application of the PCLS technique in the field of cancer research however, has not yet been well developed. We established the mouse PCLS system using perfluorodecalin (PFD) as an artificial oxygen carrier. Using this system we show that the adherence of green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeled MDA-MB-231 (highly invasive) cells to liver tissue in the PCLS was 5-fold greater than that of SK-BR-3 (less invasive) cells. In addition, we generated PCLS from THOC5, a member of transcription/export complex (TREX), knockout (KO) mice. The PCLS still expressed Gapdh or Albumin mRNAs at normal levels, while several chemokine/growth factor or metalloprotease genes, such as Cxcl12, Pdgfa, Tgfb, Wnt11, and Mmp1a genes were downregulated more than 2-fold. Interestingly, adhesion of cancer cells to THOC5 KO liver slices was far less (greater than 80% reduction) than to wild-type liver slices. Mouse PCLS cultures in the presence of PFD may serve as a useful tool for screening local adherence and invasiveness of individual cancer cells, since single cells can be observed. This method may also prove useful for identification of genes in liver-resident cells that support cancer invasion by using PCLS from transgenic liver."
1,"Pan-cancer analysis reveals correlation between RAB3B expression and tumor heterogeneity, immune microenvironment, and prognosis in multiple cancers. RAB3B is essential for the transportation and secretion within cells. Its increased expression is linked to the development and progression of various malignancies. However, understanding of RAB3B's involvement in carcinogenesis is mostly limited to specific cancer subtypes. Hence, exploring RAB3B's regulatory roles and molecular mechanisms through comprehensive cancer datasets might offer innovative approaches for managing clinical cancer. To examine the potential involvement of RAB3B in the development of cancer, we analyzed data from various sources including The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Genotype-Tissue Expression Project (GTEx), cBioPortal, HPA, UALCAN, and tissue microarray (TAM). Using bioinformatics techniques, we examined the correlation between RAB3B expression and prognosis, tumor heterogeneity, methylation modifications, and immune microenvironment across different cancer types. Our findings indicate that elevated RAB3B expression can independently predict prognosis in many tumors and has moderate accuracy for diagnosing most cancers. In most cancer types, we identified RAB3B mutations that showed a significant correlation with tumor mutational burden (TMB), mutant-allele tumor heterogeneity (MATH), and microsatellite instability (MSI). Abnormal DNA methylation patterns were also observed in most cancers compared to normal tissues. Additionally, we found significant correlations between RAB3B expression, immune cell infiltration, and immune scores across various cancers. Through pan-cancer analysis, we observed significant differences in RAB3B expression levels between tumors and normal tissues, making it a potential primary factor for cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The IHC results revealed that the expression of RAB3B in six types of tumors was consistent with the results of the pan-cancer analysis of the database. Furthermore, RAB3B showed potential associations with tumor heterogeneity and immunity. Thus, RAB3B can be utilized as an auxiliary diagnostic marker for early tumor detection and a prognostic biomarker for various tumor types."

Dual inhibition of PD-1/PD-L1 and TIGIT may act synergistically, and further enhance antitumor effects. ZSAB-TOP was a single-arm, multicenter, phase 2 study (NCT05023109) evaluating efficacy and safety of first-line tislelizumab (a PD-1 inhibitor) plus ociperlimab (a TIGIT inhibitor) and GemCis in advanced BTC. Eligible patients received tislelizumab (200 mg) and ociperlimab (900 mg) on day 1 until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, in combination with cisplatin (25 mg/m²) and gemcitabine (1000 mg/m²) on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle for a maximum eight cycles. The primary endpoint was confirmed objective response rate (ORR) evaluated by the investigator, which was compared with a historical ORR of 25% with GemCis, with a statistical superiority setting at p ≤ 0.05. From March 8, 2022, to January 18, 2023, 45 patients were enrolled. Among the 41 patients in the efficacy analysis set, the confirmed ORR was 51.2% (95% CI 35.1-67.1), achieving the statistical superiority criteria (p = 0.0003). Patients who had TIGIT<sup>+</sup>/PD-L1<sup>+</sup> (n = 16) tended to have a numerically greater confirmed ORR (75.0% [95% CI 47.6-92.7]). After a median follow-up of 14.6 months, median progression-free survival was 7.7 months (95% CI 6.0-9.4), with a median overall survival of 17.4 months (95% CI 11.7-not reached). Treatment-related adverse events of grade ≥3 occurred in 60.0% of patients; immune-mediated adverse events of any grade was observed in 42.2%, with the majority being grade 1 or 2. In conclusion, first-line tislelizumab and ociperlimab plus GemCis yielded clinically promising tumor response and survival outcomes in advanced BTC and were generally well tolerated without new safety signals."
1,"Laparoscopic deroofing for polycystic liver disease using laparoscopic fusion indocyanine green fluorescence imaging. Laparoscopic deroofing is widely used for the treatment of symptomatic polycystic liver disease (PCLD). However, bile leakage is a common complication of surgical management for PCLD. Until now, indocyanine green fluorescence imaging (IGFI) has played an active role in hepatobiliary surgery. Herein, we report the effective application of a laparoscopic fusion IGFI system, known as PINPOINT, for laparoscopic deroofing.;  In this study, we performed laparoscopic deroofing for PCLD using the laparoscopic fusion IGFI system. We conducted the procedure mainly under the normal view mode, occasionally switching to the fusion IGFI mode. First, we confirmed that the liver cysts did not contain bile using the fusion IGFI mode and then used a percutaneous puncture needle to remove the fluid from some of the giant cysts. Second, using the fusion IGFI mode, we were able to detect thin biliary branches and to adjust the division line of the cyst wall accordingly or, occasionally, to ligate the branches. Finally, we searched for and identified unexpected small bile leakage and then closed it using sutures. The laparoscopic fusion IGFI system can simultaneously show fluorescent images, such as cholangiography and the liver parenchyma, on the normal color view. In the fusion IGFI mode, the intrahepatic bile duct and liver parenchyma can be easily discriminated in real time throughout the procedure. Accordingly, the laparoscopic fusion IGFI system is useful for the surgical treatment of PCLD, in which the boundary between the liver cysts and the liver parenchyma can otherwise be difficult to identify. This technique also enables the branches of Glisson’s capsule to be identified without any other intervention. The novel application of the laparoscopic fusion IGFI system allows reliable navigation for PCLD surgery."

The first patient was a 63-year-old woman who underwent distal gastrectomy and partial hepatectomy under a diagnosis of stomach cancer with liver metastasis. The second patient was a 66-year-old man who had undergone surgery for rectal cancer 6 years previously and underwent partial hepatectomy under a diagnosis of metastasis of rectal cancer to the liver. The gastric cancer was a papillary adenocarcinoma limited to the mucosa, and the rectal cancer was a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma limited to the subserosa. The resected liver tumor in the first case measured 5.5×5.0×4.0 cm and was 2.5×1.9×1.6 cm in the second. The cut surface showed that both masses were well circumscribed and divided into lobules by fibrous tissue. They were yellowish white in color and there was no evidence of necrosis or hemorrhage. Histologically the masses consisted of fibrous areas and cellular areas, and the cellular areas consisted of fascicles of plump spindle cells mingled with varying numbers of plasma cells, lymphocytes, and histiocytes. The masses were diagnosed as IPTs. Obliterating phlebitis suggesting infection via the portal vein was seen in the adjacent liver tissue in both cases. According to previous cases reported in the literature, there are three types of cancers associated with hepatic IPT: gastrointestinal tract cancer, biliary tract cancer, and cancers that need strong systemic chemotherapy. The underlying cancer types of IPT of the liver are almost similar to those associated with pyogenic liver abscesses suggesting the etiological correlation between IPT and abscesses of the liver."
1,"LncHOXA10 drives liver TICs self-renewal and tumorigenesis via HOXA10 transcription activation. Liver cancer is one of the most deadly cancers in the world. There are various cells in liver tumor bulk, including liver tumor initiating cells (TICs), which account for liver tumorigenesis, drug resistance, relapse and metastasis. The homeobox (HOX) transcription factors play critical roles in many physiological and pathological processes, while, their roles in liver TICs and liver tumorigenesis remain unknown. An unbiased screening was performed using online-available datasets. Liver TICs were sorted by FACS using surface markers CD133, CD13 and EPCAM, or enriched by oncosphere formation assay. TIC self-renewal was examined by oncosphere formation and tumor initiation assay. Loss of function and gain of function assays were performed to examine the role of lncRNA. RNA pulldown, RNA immunoprecipitation, ChIP, Western blot and double FISH were used to explore the molecular mechanism of lncRNA. Here, we examined the expression pattern of HOX transcription factors, and found HOXA10 was overexpressed in liver cancer samples. Moreover, a divergent lncRNA of HOXA10 (termed lncHOXA10 hereafter) was also highly expressed in liver cancer and liver TICs. LncHOXA10 drove liver TIC self-renewal and liver tumorigenesis through HOXA10-dependent manner. LncHOXA10 interacted with SNF2L and recruited NURF chromatin remodeling complex to HOXA10 promoter, and thus initiated the transcription of HOXA10. Through HOXA10 transcriptional regulation, lncHOXA10 activated HOXA10 in liver TICs. LncHOXA10-HOXA10 signaling can be targeted to eliminate liver TICs. Altogether, lncHOXA10 drove HOXA10 expression and thus promoted liver TIC self-renewal. HOXA10 was the most highly expressed HOX transcription factor in liver cancer and liver TICs. LncHOXA10 drove the transcriptional activation of HOXA10. This work revealed the important role of HOX transcription factor in liver TIC self-renewal and added a new layer for liver TIC regulation."
1,"Granulin-epithelin precursor interacts with 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein in hepatocellular carcinoma Granulin-epithelin precursor (GEP) is a secretory growth factor, which has been demonstrated to control cancer growth, invasion, drug resistance and immune escape. Our previous studies and others also demonstrated its potential in targeted therapy. Comprehensive characterization of GEP partner on cancer cells are warranted. We have previously shown that GEP interacted with heparan sulfate on the surface of liver cancer cells and the interaction is crucial for GEP-mediated signaling transduction. This study aims to characterize GEP protein partner at the cell membrane with the co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry approach. The membrane fraction from liver cancer model Hep3B was used for capturing binding partner with the specific monoclonal antibody against GEP. The precipitated proteins were analyzed by mass spectrometry. After identifying the GEP binding partner, this specific interaction was validated in additional liver cancer cell line HepG2 by co-immunoprecipitation using GRP78 and GEP antibodies, respectively, as the bait. GRP78 transcript levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) clinical samples (n = 77 pairs) were examined by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. GEP and GRP78 protein expressions were investigated by immunohistochemistry on paraffin sections. We identified the GEP-binding protein as 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78, also named heat shock 70-kDa protein 5, HSPA5). This interaction was validated in independent HCC cell lines. Increased GRP78 mRNA levels were demonstrated in liver cancer tissues compared with the paralleled liver tissues (t-test, P = 0.002). GRP78 and GEP transcript levels were significantly correlated (Spearman’s correlation, P = 0.001), and the proteins were also detectable in the cytoplasm of liver cancer cells by immunohistochemical staining. GRP78 and GEP are interacting protein partners in liver cancer cells and may play a role in GEP-mediated cancer progression in HCC."

1,"Identification and Characterization of Cadmium-Related Genes in Liver Carcinoma. Evidence indicates that exposure to heavy trace element might be a risk factor for liver carcinoma. Cadmium has been supposed to be a carcinogen that has a correlation with the risk of a number of cancers, including liver cancer. However, the mechanisms underlying Cadmium-induced malignant transformation in liver cells are not fully understood. In the present study, we aimed to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that might play a role in both the Cadmium-related liver cell transformation and the development of liver cancer. Microarray-based gene expression profiles concerning liver carcinoma vs non-cancerous tissue (GSE64041) and Cadmium-treated liver cells vs controls (GSE8865 and GSE31286), respectively, were retrieved from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Then, DEGs of each profile were calculated and screened. The intersection of each DEGs was obtained by Venn analysis. Afterwards, the possible roles of the selected genes in cancer development were evaluated by using Oncomine database and TCGA cohort analysis. Consequently, three DEGs, LRAT, SLC7A11, and ITGA2, were selected for further analysis. SLC7A11 and ITGA2, but not LRAT, were upregulated in liver cancer compared with those in normal tissues, respectively. After using a TCGA cohort analysis, results failed to show a significant correlation between SLC7A11 or ITGA2 expression and clinical parameters. However, the survival analysis showed that patients with high expression levels of SLC7A11 had a shorter overall survival time relative to those of the patients with low levels. In conclusion, SLC7A11 and ITGA2 might play a role in the Cadmium-induced liver cell damage or transformation, and the development of liver carcinoma. SLC7A11 might be a prognostic factor for patients with liver carcinoma. Future validation experiments are needed to verify the results."
1,"Long-term survival trends of gastric cancer patients between 1972 and 2011 in Qidong. There have been few reports on long-term survival of gastric cancer patients. This study analyzed the survival data of gastric cancer patients obtained from the population-based Qidong Cancer Registry between 1972 and 2011, providing a basis for evaluation of gastric cancer treatment and prognosis. The cumulative observed survival rate and relative survival rate of gastric cancer patients were calculated using Hakulinen’s method via the SURV3.01 software, which was developed by the Finnish Cancer Registry. The date of the last follow-up for the survival status of the 15,401 registered cases was April 30, 2012. The 1-, 5-, 10-, 20-, and 30-year observed survival rates were 33.82%, 14.18%, 10.35%, 6.63%, and 4.19%, respectively, and the 1-, 5-, 10-, 20-, and 30-year relative survival rates were 35.43%, 18.13%, 17.50%, 21.96%, and 32.84%, respectively. For males, the corresponding observed survival rates were 34.50%, 14.40%, 10.42%, 6.46%, and 4.05%, and the corresponding relative survival rates were 36.23%, 18.67%, 18.28%, 23.73%, and 38.61%. For females, the corresponding observed survival rates were 32.62%, 13.80%, 10.22%, 6.95%, and 4.46%, and the corresponding relative survival rates were 34.03%, 17.21%, 16.28%, 19.70%, and 26.78%. Significant differences in relative survival rates were observed between sexes (P = 0.003). For the 15–34, 35–44, 45–54, 55–64, 65–74, and 75+ age groups, the 5-year relative survival rates were 16.13%, 21.77%, 18.63%, 12.61%, 7.99%, and 2.94%, respectively, and the 10-year relative survival rates were 16.49%, 22.83%, 20.50%, 15.97%, 15.88%, and 15.73%, respectively. Remarkable improvement could be observed for the 5-, 10-, and 15-year relative survival rates in Qidong beginning in the 1980s. The survival outcome of registered gastric cancer cases in Qidong showed gradual progress over the past two decades."
1,"Constitutive TDO2 expression promotes liver cancer progression by an autocrine IL-6 signaling pathway. Background Increased tryptophan (Trp) metabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)/tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) represents one of the most studied pathways for immunosuppression in tumor tissues. However, the pro-tumor effects induced by Trp metabolism remain controversial. Methods The paraffin sections of tumor tissues were obtained from patients with liver cancer and examined by immunohistochemical staining to investigate the role of Trp metabolic enzymes. To further confirm the pro-tumor effects induced by TDO2, we established TDO2 overexpression SMC-7721 and HepG2 liver cancer cell lines, and western blotting, cell proliferation, and colony formation were evaluated. Meanwhile, liver cancer subcutaneous mice models were established, and the tumorigenic rates of SMC-7721 cells, tumor volume and survival of bearing mice were calculated. In addition, the survival data of liver cancer patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were downloaded to analyze the effect of TDO2 expression on the survival of patients with liver cancer. Results Here, we showed that constitutive TDO2 expression gave rise to liver cancer through upregulation of Trp metabolism. And the TDO2 expression was positively correlated with the poor prognosis in liver cancer patients. TDO2 expression in tumor cells accounted for the release of kynurenine (Kyn), which activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) to promote liver cancer cells proliferation. Mechanistically, we found that AhR expression contributed to the secretion of Interleukin-6 (IL-6), thereby promoting tumor cells proliferation through the STAT3 and NF-kB/TIM4 signals. Interrupt of AhR signals by PDM2 revealed improved outcomes in subcutaneous tumor-bearing mice. Conclusions Together, our study showed that the TDO2/Kyn/AhR/IL-6 signaling pathway was a novel mechanism underlying the malignancy of liver cancer, and suggested that AhR signals might be a valuable therapeutic target for tumor therapy."

1,"Decreased hepatic function in patients with hepatoma or liver metastasis monitored by a hepatocyte specific galactosylated radioligand. 99mTc-galactosylated neoglycoalbumin (99mTc-NGA) is a hepatocyte-specific tracer that, after injection into the blood stream, delivers radioactivity selectively to the liver. This is based upon chemical recognition and binding by the hepatic binding protein (HBP), a receptor specific for galactosylated glycoproteins. Liver tissue samples were obtained intraoperatively from patients undergoing surgery for various cancers. The concentration of specific HBP receptors in the liver (normal liver, hepatoma, liver metastasis) was calculated from the in vitro binding of 99mTc-NGA. One week after surgery, the in vivo HBP density was also measured in some of these patients after injection of 3.5 mg (50 nmol per patient) 99mTc-NGA (150-200 MBq) for simulation of 99mTc-NGA kinetics. Comparison of in vitro and in vivo HBP concentration in the liver showed values in the same concentration range. In patients with hepatoma or liver metastasis a significantly (P less than 0.01) decreased global HBP density was found in vivo compared to controls. The values obtained for in vivo HBP concentration in the liver amounted to 0.38 +/- 0.05 mumol l-1 liver for patients with hepatoma, to 0.4 +/- 0.1 mumol l-1 in patients with liver metastasis and to 94 +/- 0.05 mumol l-1 liver in cancer patients without liver malignancy. In vitro investigation of HBP density revealed the malignant liver tissue to have a significantly (P less than 0.0001) decreased or almost (completely) absent HBP receptor density compared to the normal tissue apart from the cancer area. It is concluded that determination of HBP density in vivo via a specific tracer is a new, simple and reliable approach for the determination of remaining hepatic function in patients with primary or secondary liver cancer."

Another 100 patients with hepatic focal nodular hyperplasia in the same period were collected as control group. The diagnostic value of miR-21 and CT on liver cancer was observed. The level of miR-21 in cancer group was significantly higher than that in control group, the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was tested. It was found that the AFP level in cancer group was significantly higher than that in control group (p < 0.001). The correlation between AFP and miR-21 levels in liver cancer patients was detected. It turned out that AFP and miR-21 had correlation. According to receiver operating curve (ROC) calculation results, the best cut-off value for miR-21 diagnosis was 4.142.

Comparing the value of single diagnosis and combined diagnosis, we found that the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of combined diagnosis were significantly higher than that of single diagnosis (p < 0.05). CT combined with miR-21 has great diagnostic value in liver cancer and may be a potential diagnostic indicator for liver cancer."
1,"Mass screening for liver cancer: results from a demonstration screening project in Zhongshan City, China. Current Chinese national guidelines recommend routine screening for liver cancer in patients positive for HBsAg, irrespective of fibrosis status, age, or family history of liver cancer. We aim to evaluate whether the recommended screening strategy could reduce liver-cancer-specific mortality. We conducted a liver cancer mass screening trial in Xiaolan Town, Zhongshan City, China, among residents aged 35–64 years in 2012. All volunteers were offered serological testing for hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg). We proposed biannual screening using serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ultrasonography examination for subjects positive for HBsAg. Among 17,966 participants (26.2% of 68,510 eligible residents) who were free of liver cancer at baseline in 2012, we identified 57 incident cases of liver cancer within the first 4 years of follow-up (i.e., 43 among 2,848 HBsAg-positive participants and 14 among 15,118 HBsAg-negative participants), compared with 104 cases identified in non-participants (N = 50,544). A total of 207 participants had the recommended number of ultrasonography examinations (every 6 months) during the screening period. Compared with cases identified from non-participants, the cases arising among participants were more likely to be at early stage and had better survival than those among non-participants. However, we did not observe a reduction in liver cancer-specific mortality rate among participants (relative risk = 1.04, 95% confidence interval = 0.68, 1.58, P = 0.856). Our demonstration screening study does not show a reduction in liver cancer mortality within the first 4 years of follow-up according to current guidance in China, although long-term efficacy remains to be evaluated. Targeted surveillance among high-risk individuals as recommended by international guidelines, along with measures to improve compliance, should be evaluated in the Chinese population."
1,"RNF157 targets RIG-I/DDX58 to promote proliferation in liver cancer. Liver cancer is one of the most common malignant tumours in humans, and a large proportion of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage due to rapid growth and distant metastasis; thus, there is an urgent need to identify critical genes involved in the development of liver cancer. In this study, we investigated the role of RING finger protein 157 (RNF157) in liver cancer proliferation and the related mechanisms. First, we used bioinformatics counting for database mining of RNF157 expression in hepatocellular carcinoma and paracancerous tissues and its relationship with prognosis. We detected the expression level of RNF157 in human samples and different liver cancer cell lines via fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), Western blot, and immunohistochemistry (IHC). Subsequently, virus transfection was used to construct knockdown and overexpressed stably transfected cell lines to test the effect of RNF157 on the proliferation of liver cancer. Immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) was used to verify the binding and regulatory relationship between RNF157 and RIG-I/DDX58. We found that RNF157 expression was significantly upregulated in liver cancer tissues and correlated with poor prognosis. In addition, knockdown of RNF157 expression inhibited liver cancer cell proliferation and overexpression of RNF157 promoted liver cancer cell proliferation. Co-IP results revealed that RNF157 binds to and downregulates the expression level of RIG-I/DDX58, further suggesting that RNF157 binds to and ubiquitinates RIG-I/DDX58 at residue 48 of the lysine, which leads to a significant increase in the expression level of RIG-I/DDX58. In this study, we found that RNF157 is a tumour-promoting ubiquitin ligase that promotes liver cancer growth by targeting RIG-I/DDX58 for degradation. Thus, RNF157 has the potential to be a therapeutic target for liver cancer."
1,"Incidence and mortality rates of selected infection-related cancers in Puerto Rico and in the United States Background: In 2002, 17.8% of the global cancer burden was attributable to infections. This study assessed the agestandardized incidence and mortality rates of stomach, liver, and cervical cancer in Puerto Rico (PR) for the period 19922003 and compared them to those of Hispanics (USH), non-Hispanic Whites (NHW), and non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) in the United States (US). Methods: Age-standardized rates [ASR(World)] were calculated based on cancer incidence and mortality data from the PR Cancer Central Registry and SEER, using the direct method and the world population as the standard. Annual percent changes (APC) were calculated using the Poisson regression model from 1992-2003. Results: The incidence and mortality rates from stomach, liver and cervical cancer were lower in NHW than PR; with the exception of mortality from cervical cancer which was similar in both populations. Meanwhile, the incidence rates of stomach, liver and cervical cancers were similar between NHB and PR; except for NHB women who had a lower incidence rate of liver cancer than women in PR. NHB had a lower mortality from liver cancer than persons in PR, and similar mortality from stomach cancer. Conclusions: The burden of liver, stomach, and cervical cancer in PR compares to that of USH and NHB and continues to be a public health priority. Public health efforts are necessary to further decrease the burden of cancers associated to infections in these groups, the largest minority population groups in the US. Future studies need to identify factors that may prevent infections with cancer-related agents in these populations. Strategies to increase the use of preventive strategies, such as vaccination and screening, among minority populations should also be developed."
1,"Hepatic proliferation after partial liver irradiation in Sprague–Dawley rats The liver has powerful capability to proliferate in response to various injuries, but little is known as to liver proliferation after irradiation (IR) injury. This study investigated whether liver proliferation could be stimulated in low-dose irradiated liver by partial liver IR injury with high dose radiation. Sprague–Dawley rats were irradiated by 6-MV X-ray with single dose of 25 Gy to the right-half liver, while the left-half liver was shielded (0.7 Gy) or irradiated with single doses of 3.2, 5.6, and 8.0 Gy, respectively. Hepatic proliferation in the shielded and low-dose irradiated left-half liver was evaluated by serum hepatic growth factor (HGF), proliferating cell nuclei antigen (PCNA), liver proliferation index (PI), hepatocyte mitosis index (MI). The observation time was 0 day (before IR), 30, 60, 90, and 120 days after IR. Our results showed that serum HGF and hepatocyte HGF mRNA increased after IR with HGF mRNA peak on day 30 in the shielded and low-dose irradiated left-half livers, and their values increased as the dose increased to the left-half liver. Liver PI and PCNA mRNA peaked on day 60 with stronger expressions in higher doses-irradiated livers. MI increased after IR, with the peak noted on day 60 in the shielded and on day 90 in the low-dose irradiated left-half livers. There was a 30 day delay between MI peaks in the shielded and low-dose irradiated livers. In conclusion, 25 Gy partial liver IR injury could stimulate the shielded liver and low-dose irradiated liver to proliferate. In the livers receiving a dose range of 3.2–8.0 Gy, the proliferation was stronger in higher doses-irradiated liver than the low-dose irradiated. However, IR delayed hepatocyte mitosis."

1,"A novel liver retraction method in laparoscopic gastrectomy for gastric cancer Retracting the lateral liver segment during laparoscopic distal gastrectomy is important for achieving an optimal surgical field. However, excessive force may injure the liver, causing temporary abnormalities of liver function tests after laparoscopic surgery. We developed a new liver retraction method and assessed its safety and utility. We retrospectively analyzed records in our surgical database of consecutive surgical patients who underwent laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer. We divided the 229 patients into two groups based on the liver retraction method used, either flexible liver retraction with clipping and suturing (FLICS) or the Nathanson retractor (NR). One-to-one propensity score matching was performed to match patients, resulting in the records of 53 pairs of cases extracted from the database. Operative and postoperative outcomes were assessed, including following the values of serum liver enzymes, total bilirubin, and C-reactive protein until postoperative day 30. There were no significant differences in patient characteristics or preoperative data in the two groups. The retraction method was not changed intraoperatively for any patients. The operative time was significantly shorter in the FLICS group, but the amount of bleeding did not differ. Liver injury was not observed as a result of liver retraction during surgery. In both groups, serum liver enzymes temporarily increased after surgery but improved rapidly thereafter. The postoperative increases in aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and C-reactive protein levels were significantly lower in the FLICS than in the NR group. No serious complications associated with liver retraction were observed in either group. Our new liver retraction technique provided an optimal surgical field without inducing liver dysfunction. It is a simple, safe, and effective liver retraction technique."
1,"Inhibition of USP7 enhances CD8+ T cell activity in liver cancer by suppressing PRDM1-mediated FGL1 upregulation. Lymphocyte activation gene 3 (LAG3), an immune checkpoint molecule expressed on activated T cells, functions as a negative regulator of immune responses. Persistent antigen exposure in the tumor microenvironment results in sustained LAG3 expression on T cells, contributing to T cell dysfunction. Fibrinogen-like protein 1 (FGL1) has been identified as a major ligand of LAG3, and FGL1/LAG3 interaction forms a novel immune checkpoint pathway that results in tumor immune evasion. In addition, ubiquitin-specific peptidase 7 (USP7) plays a crucial role in cancer development. In this study we investigated the role of USP7 in modulation of FGL1-mediated liver cancer immune evasion. We showed that knockdown of USP7 or treatment with USP7 inhibitor P5091 suppressed liver cancer growth by promoting CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activity in Hepa1-6 xenograft mice and in HepG2 or Huh7 cells co-cultured with T cells, whereas USP7 overexpression produced the opposite effect. We found that USP7 upregulated FGL1 in HepG2 and Huh7 cells by deubiquitination of transcriptional factor PR domain zinc finger protein 1 (PRDM1), which transcriptionally activated FGL1, and attenuated the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activity, leading to the liver cancer growth. Interestingly, USP7 could be transcriptionally stimulated by PRDM1 as well in a positive feedback loop. P5091, an inhibitor of USP7, was able to downregulate FGL1 expression, thus enhancing CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activity. In an immunocompetent liver cancer mouse model, the dual blockade of USP7 and LAG3 resulted in a superior antitumor activity compared with anti-LAG3 therapy alone. We conclude that USP7 diminishes CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell activity by a USP7/PRDM1 positive feedback loop on FGL1 production in liver cancer; USP7 might be a promising target for liver cancer immunotherapy."
1,"Convergent somatic mutations in metabolism genes in chronic liver disease The progression of chronic liver disease to hepatocellular carcinoma is caused by the acquisition of somatic mutations that affect 20–30 cancer genes1–8. Burdens of somatic mutations are higher and clonal expansions larger in chronic liver disease9–13 than in normal liver13–16, which enables positive selection to shape the genomic landscape9–13. Here we analysed somatic mutations from 1,590 genomes across 34 liver samples, including healthy controls, alcohol-related liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Seven of the 29 patients with liver disease had mutations in FOXO1, the major transcription factor in insulin signalling. These mutations affected a single hotspot within the gene, impairing the insulin-mediated nuclear export of FOXO1. Notably, six of the seven patients with FOXO1S22W hotspot mutations showed convergent evolution, with variants acquired independently by up to nine distinct hepatocyte clones per patient. CIDEB, which regulates lipid droplet metabolism in hepatocytes17–19, and GPAM, which produces storage triacylglycerol from free fatty acids20,21, also had a significant excess of mutations. We again observed frequent convergent evolution: up to fourteen independent clones per patient with CIDEB mutations and up to seven clones per patient with GPAM mutations. Mutations in metabolism genes were distributed across multiple anatomical segments of the liver, increased clone size and were seen in both alcohol-related liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, but rarely in hepatocellular carcinoma. Master regulators of metabolic pathways are a frequent target of convergent somatic mutation in alcohol-related and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Whole-genome sequencing analysis of somatic mutations in liver samples from patients with chronic liver disease identifies driver mutations in metabolism-related genes such as FOXO1, and shows that these variants frequently exhibit convergent evolution."
1,"A natural process of cirrhosis resolution and deceleration of liver regeneration after thioacetamide withdrawal in a rat model Characteristics of thioacetamide (TAA)-induced liver cirrhosis in rat was observed for 120 days after TAA withdrawal as part of the radiobiological study of partial liver irradiation on TAA-induced cirrhotic rats. The natural process focused on cirrhosis and regeneration was recorded as a baseline condition for the interpretation of the outcome of the partial liver irradiation study. Cirrhosis in rats was successfully induced by drinking 0.03% TAA water orally for 29 weeks with a modeling rate of 96%. After establishment of the cirrhosis model, the rats were observed for 120 days upon TAA withdrawal to investigate the dynamic changes of cirrhosis and regeneration. The following characteristics were observed: (1) Histological changes; (2) Liver functions; (3) Cirrhosis: trichrome stain, quantification of hydroxyproline in hydrolysed liver tissue and TGF-β1; (4) Liver regeneration: liver index, hepatocyte mitotic index (MI), hepatocyte proliferation index (PI) by flow cytometry, PCNA labeling index (LI) by IHC and expression of PCNA mRNA; and (5) Growth factors: serum HGF, VEGF, TGF-α, and IL-6. After TAA withdrawal, gradual improvement in liver functions was noted with decreases of ALT, AST, and ALP, and increase of PA. The resolution of cirrhosis was evident by histological improvement with attenuation of collagen fiber and decrease of TGF-β1 IHC index, and also decrease of trichrome stain and hydroxyproline content. However, cirrhosis was still existed on 120 days after TAA withdrawal. Significant deceleration of liver regeneration was demonstrated with TAA withdrawal, evidenced by decrease of MI and PI, reduced expression of PCNA mRNA and PCNA LI. In conclusion, upon TAA withdrawal hepatic cirrhosis was continuously resolved, but persisted up to 120 days, and liver regeneration was significantly decelerated."

1,"Process of hepatic metastasis from pancreatic cancer: biology with clinical significance. Pancreatic cancer shows a remarkable preference for the liver to establish secondary tumors. Selective metastasis to the liver is attributed to the development of potential microenvironment for the survival of pancreatic cancer cells. This review aims to provide a full understanding of the hepatic metastatic process from circulating pancreatic cancer cells to their settlement in the liver, serving as a basic theory for efficient prediction and treatment of metastatic diseases. A systematic search of relevant original articles and reviews was performed on PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library for the purpose of this review. Three interrelated phases are delineated as the contributions of the interaction between pancreatic cancer cells and the liver to hepatic metastasis process. Chemotaxis of disseminated pancreatic cancer cells and simultaneous defensive formation of platelets or neutrophils facilitate specific metastasis toward the liver. Remodeling of extracellular matrix and stromal cells in hepatic lobules and angiogenesis induced by proangiogenic factors support the survival and growth of clinical micrometastasis colonizing the liver. The bimodal role of the immune system or prevalence of cancer cells over the immune system makes metastatic progression successfully proceed from micrometastasis to macrometastasis. Pancreatic cancer is an appropriate research object of cancer metastasis representing more than a straight cascade. If any of the successive or simultaneous phases, especially tumor-induced immunosuppression, is totally disrupted, hepatic metastasis will be temporarily under control or even cancelled forever. To shrink cancers on multiple fronts and prolong survival for patients, novel oral or intravenous anti-cancer agents covering one or different phases of metastatic pancreatic cancer are expected to be integrated into innovative strategies on the premise of safety and efficacious biostability."
1,"LncGPR107 drives the self-renewal of liver tumor initiating cells and liver tumorigenesis through GPR107-dependent manner With self-renewal and differentiation properties, liver tumor initiating cells (TICs) are the reasons for tumor initiation, metastasis and drug resistance. G protein coupled receptors (GPCR) are critical modulators in many physiological and pathological processes. While, their roles in liver TICs are unknown. An unbiased screening was performed using online-available data dataset. Liver TICs were sorted by FACS with surface marker CD133, or enriched by oncosphere formation. TIC self-renewal was examined by oncosphere formation and tumor initiation assay. Loss of function and gain of function assays were performed to examine the role of lncRNA. RNA pulldown, RNA immunoprecipitation, ChIP, western blot and double FISH were used explore the molecular mechanism of lncRNA. We performed an unbiased screening for GPCR expression in liver cancers, and found GPR107 was the most highly expressed GPCR in liver cancer and liver TICs. GPR107 was essential for the self-renewal of liver TICs. The expression of GPR107 was regulated by a long noncoding RNA lncGPR107. LncGPR107 was also highly expressed in liver cancers and liver TICs. LncGPR107 drove the self-renewal of liver TICs through GPR107. Moreover, lncGPR107 recruited SRCAP complex to GPR107 promoter to drive its transcriptional activation. LncGPR107 depletion inhibited the binding of SRCAP complex and GPR107 promoter and subsequent GPR107 expression. Moreover, LncGPR107-SRCAP-GPR107 can be targeted for liver TIC elimination. GPR107 was the most highly expressed GPCR in liver cancer and liver TICs. LncGPR107 participated in the transcriptional regulation of GPR107 in cis, through recruiting SRCAP remodeling complex to GPR107 promoter. This work revealed the important role of GPCR signaling in liver TIC self-renewal and added a new layer for liver TIC and GPCR regulation."

1,"Radiomics score: a potential prognostic imaging feature for postoperative survival of solitary HCC patients Radiomics is an emerging field in oncological research. In this study, we aimed at developing a radiomics score (rad-score) to estimate postoperative recurrence and survival in patients with solitary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 319 solitary HCC patients (training cohort: n = 212; validation cohort: n = 107) were enrolled. Radiomics features were extracted from the artery phase of preoperatively acquired computed tomography (CT) in all patients. A rad-score was generated by using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) logistic model. Kaplan-Meier and Cox’s hazard regression analyses were used to evaluate the prognostic significance of the rad-score. Final nomograms predicting recurrence and survival of solitary HCC patients were established based on the rad-score and clinicopathological factors. C-index and calibration statistics were used to assess the performance of nomograms. Six potential radiomics features were selected out of 110 texture features to formulate the rad-score. Low rad-score positively correlated with aggressive tumor phenotypes, like larger tumor size and vascular invasion. Meanwhile, low rad-score was significantly associated with increased recurrence and reduced survival. In addition, multivariate analysis identified the rad-score as an independent prognostic factor (recurrence: Hazard ratio (HR): 2.472, 95% confident interval (CI): 1.339–4.564, p = 0.004;survival: HR: 1.558, 95%CI: 1.022–2.375, p = 0.039). Notably, the nomogram integrating rad-score had a better prognostic performance as compared with traditional staging systems. These results were further confirmed in the validation cohort. The preoperative CT image based rad-score was an independent prognostic factor for the postoperative outcome of solitary HCC patients. This score may be complementary to the current staging system and help to stratify individualized treatments for solitary HCC patients."
1,"Laparoscopically guided bipolar radiofrequency ablation of areas of porcine liver Background: Bipolar radiofrequency ablation (BRFA) is a promising technique with which to treat unresectable primary and metastatic liver tumors. Its effects on normal liver tissue and postoperative liver function, however, are unknown. We performed this study to determine (1) the feasibility of using laparoscopic ultrasound to guide placement of BRFA needle electrodes in the liver and (2) the histopathologic, hepatic biochemical, and systemic hemodynamic responses to BRFA.;  ; Methods: Two BRFA lesions were created in the liver of adult domestic pigs to ablate 8–10% of the normal liver volume. Laparoscopic ultrasound was used to guide creation of one peripheral liver lesion and one central liver lesion (with a major hepatic or portal venous vein branch in the center of the BRFA lesions) in each animal. BRFA of liver tissue was performed by passing 12 W of RF power for 16 min across two 16-gauge active-needle electrodes placed 3 cm apart.;  ; Results: All animals survived the procedure without significant hemodynamic alterations during or after BRFA. All animals had a transient elevation in serum transaminase levels that returned to normal within 1 week of the BRFA of liver tissue. Gross and microscopic histopathology of the BRFA lesions revealed 2.0–2.5-cm zones of complete coagulative necrosis around and between the BRFA needle tracks without destruction of major blood vessel walls.;  ; Conclusions: This study demonstrates (1) that laparoscopic ultrasound can be used to guide placement of BRFA needles in the liver and (2) that BRFA produces focal destruction of liver without significant systemic hemodynamic responses or alterations in liver function. Further studies of this technique to ablate malignant liver tumors are ongoing."
1,"Bevacizumab induces ferroptosis and enhances CD8+ T cell immune activity in liver cancer via modulating HAT1 and increasing IL-9. Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 antibody of VEGF, and inhibits angiogenesis and tumor growth in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Ferroptosis, a new form of regulated cell death function independently of the apoptotic machinery, has been accepted as an attractive target for pharmacological intervention; the ferroptosis pathway can enhance cell immune activity of anti-PD1 immunotherapy in HCC. In this study we investigated whether and how bevacizumab regulated ferroptosis and immune activity in liver cancer. Firstly, we performed RNA-sequencing in bevacizumab-treated human liver cancer cell line HepG2 cells, and found that bevacizumab significantly altered the expression of a number of genes including VEGF, PI3K, HAT1, SLC7A11 and IL-9 in liver cancer, bevacizumab upregulated 37 ferroptosis-related drivers, and downregulated 17 ferroptosis-related suppressors in particular. We demonstrated that bevacizumab triggered ferroptosis in liver cancer cells by driving VEGF/PI3K/HAT1/SLC7A11 axis. Clinical data confirmed that the expression levels of VEGF were positively associated with those of PI3K, HAT1 and SLC7A11 in HCC tissues. Meanwhile, we found that bevacizumab enhanced immune cell activity in tumor immune-microenvironment. We identified that HAT1 up-regulated miR-143 targeting IL-9 mRNA 3'UTR in liver cancer cells; bevacizumab treatment resulted in the increase of IL-9 levels and its secretion via VEGF/PI3K/HAT1/miR-143/IL-9 axis, which led to the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo through increasing the release of IL-2 and Granzyme B from activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. We conclude that in addition to inhibiting angiogenesis, bevacizumab induces ferroptosis and enhances CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immune activity in liver cancer. This study provides new insight into the mechanisms by which bevacizumab synergistically modulates ferroptosis and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell immune activity in liver cancer."
1,"ADAR1-dependent miR-3144-3p editing simultaneously induces MSI2 expression and suppresses SLC38A4 expression in liver cancer. Aberrant adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, catalyzed by adenosine deaminase acting on double-stranded RNA (ADAR), has been implicated in various cancers, but the mechanisms by which microRNA (miRNA) editing contributes to cancer development are largely unknown. Our multistage hepatocellular carcinogenesis transcriptome data analyses, together with publicly available data, indicated that ADAR1 was the most profoundly dysregulated gene among RNA-editing enzyme family members in liver cancer. Targeted inactivation of ADAR1 inhibited the in vitro tumorigenesis of liver cancer cells. An integrative computational analyses of RNA-edited hotspots and the known editing frequency of miRNAs suggested that the miRNA miR-3144-3p was edited by ADAR1 during liver cancer progression. Specifically, ADAR1 promoted A-to-I editing of canonical miR-3144-3p to replace the adenosine at Position 3 in the seed region with a guanine (ED_miR-3144-3p(3_A < G)) in liver cancer cells. We then demonstrated that Musashi RNA-binding protein 2 (MSI2) was a specific target of miR-3144-3p and that MSI2 overexpression was due to excessive ADAR1-dependent over-editing of canonical miR-3144-3p in liver cancer. In addition, target prediction analyses and validation experiments identified solute carrier family 38 member 4 (SLC38A4) as a specific gene target of ED_miR-3144-3p(3_A < G). The ectopic expression of both ADAR1 and the ED_miR-3144-3p(3_A < G) mimic enhanced mitotic activities, and ADAR1 suppressed SLC38A4 expression in liver cancer cells. Treatments with mouse-specific ADAR1-, MSI2-siRNA-, or SLC38A4-expressing plasmids suppressed tumorigenesis and tumor growth in a mouse model of spontaneous liver cancer. Our findings suggest that the aberrant regulation of ADAR1 augments oncogenic MSI2 effects by excessively editing canonical miR-3144-3p and that the resultant ED_miR-3144-3p(3_A < G) simultaneously suppresses tumor suppressor SLC38A4 expression, contributing to hepatocellular carcinogenesis."

1,"Changes in the epidemiological trends of primary liver cancer in the Asia-Pacific region. Primary liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality.

This study aims to analyze the epidemiology of primary liver cancer in the Asia-Pacific region. We evaluated regional and national data from the Global Burden of Disease study spanning 2010 to 2019 to assess the age-standardized incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years associated with primary liver cancer in the Asia-Pacific region. During the study period, there were an estimated 364,700 new cases of primary liver cancer and 324,100 deaths, accounting for 68 and 67% of the global totals, respectively. Upward trends were observed in the age-standardized incidence rates of primary liver cancer due to metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MASLD) and alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as an increase in primary liver cancer from Hepatitis B virus infection in the Western Pacific region. Notably, approximately 17% of new cases occurred in individuals aged 15-49 years. Despite an overall decline in the burden of primary liver cancer in the Asia-Pacific region over the past decade, increases in incidence were noted for several etiologies, including MASLD and ALD. However, viral hepatitis remains the leading cause, responsible for over 60% of the total burden. These findings underscore the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address the rising burden of primary liver cancer in the Asia-Pacific region."

1,"Gallstones, cholecystectomy and risk of cancers of the liver, biliary tract and pancreas. To examine the association between gallstones and cholecystectomy, we conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study in Denmark. Patients with a discharge diagnosis of gallstones from 1977 to 1989 were identified from the Danish National Registry of Patients and followed up for cancer occurrence until death or the end of 1993 by record linkage to the Danish Cancer Registry. Included in the cohort were 60 176 patients, with 471 450 person-years of follow-up. Cancer risks were estimated by standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) stratified by years of follow-up and by cholecystectomy status. Among patients without cholecystectomy, the risks at 5 or more years of follow-up were significantly elevated for cancers of liver (SIR = 2.0, CI = 1.2-3.1) and gallbladder (SIR = 2.7, CI = 1.5-4.4) and near unity for cancers of extrahepatic bile duct (SIR = 1.1), ampulla of Vater (SIR = 1.0) and pancreas (SIR = 1.1). The excess risk of liver cancer was seen only among patients with a history of hepatic disease. Among cholecystectomy patients, the risks at 5 or more years of follow-up declined for cancers of liver (SIR = 1.1) and extrahepatic bile duct (SIR = 0.7), but were elevated for cancers of ampulla of Vater (SIR = 2.0, CI = 1.0-3.7) and pancreas (SIR = 1.3, CI = 1.1-1.6). These findings confirm that gallstone disease increases the risk of gallbladder cancer, whereas cholecystectomy appears to increase the risk of cancers of ampulla of Vater and pancreas. Further research is needed to clarify the carcinogenic risks associated with gallstones and cholecystectomy and to define the mechanisms involved."
1,"Iodized oil enhances the thermal effect of high-intensity focused ultrasound on ablating experimental liver cancer. The influence of the biological medium on high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) therapy for ablating experimental liver cancer was studied. In study 1, the temperature rise in the focal zone in the presence of iodized oil or castor oil was observed in vitro. The results showed that HIFU with iodized oil produced a higher and faster temperature rise than did HIFU with castor oil, whether high-power (500 W/cm2) or relatively low-power (136 W/cm2) conditions were used (P=0.0008 and P=0.0004 respectively). With the excised liver samples, the temperature also rose higher and more rapidly after injection of iodized oil into the liver than when castor oil was injected (P=0.0239), and the target liver tissue revealed more radically and extensive destruction with iodized oil than with castor oil. In study 2, 48 nude mice, bearing primary liver cancer LTNM4 implanted subcutaneously, were randomly divided into four groups. Group I (n=12) were the controls, group II (n=12) were injected with iodized oil alone, group III (n=12) received HIFU treatement, and group IV (n=12) were exposed to HIFU after iodized oil injection. Significant inhibition of tumor growth was seen in groups III and IV as compared with group I or group II (P<0.05), the tumor growth inhibition rate on the 28th day after treatment being 87% and 93% respectively. Significantly improved survival was noted in groups III and IV compared with groups I and II (P<0.05). Histologically, group IV showed more complete tumor necrosis than did group III. These data suggest that HIFU combined with iodized oil might have achieve of synergism, location and targeting in the treatment of liver cancer."
1,"Clinicopathological significance of fibrotic capsule formation around liver metastasis from colorectal cancer. Purpose: The fibrous capsule around hepatocellular carcinoma is well known to be an indicator of a good prognosis. However, the fibrotic stromal response in the liver to a metastatic tumor remains unclear. Patients and methods: In order to clarify the prevalence of fibrotic capsular formation around liver metastases as well as the prognostic and biological significance of the fibrotic capsule, 69 colorectal cancer patients, who underwent radical hepatectomy due to liver metastases, were investigated using immunohistochemical methods. Results: Encapsulated metastases as defined by a thick fibrotic band surrounding the entire surface of a metastasis were detected in 20% of the cases. The rate of initial recurrence in the remnant liver, which is a strong indicator for poor prognosis of colorectal liver metastasis, was significantly lower in the encapsulated metastasis group as compared with the non-encapsulated metastasis group. Proliferating fibroblastic cells in the capsule were myofibroblasts positively stained for α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and they deposited dense extracellular matrices rich in collagen Type 1 in the layer of the inner half and secreted MMP-1, MMP-2, and TIMP-1 in the layer of the outer half of the capsule. Activation of α-SMA positive hepatic stellate cells (HSC) was also observed in the liver parenchyma adjacent to metastases. Conclusions: The results indicate that fibrotic capsular formation is associated with a lower rate of initial local recurrence in the remnant liver, and that the capsule may serve as a mechanical and chemical barrier to local invasion by metastatic tumor cells. Proliferating stromal cells in the capsule are myofibroblasts, probably derived from HSC activated by colorectal liver metastasis in the liver parenchyma."
1,"Leiomyosarcoma of the sigmoid colon with multiple liver metastases and gastric cancer: a case report Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) of the gastrointestinal tract is an extremely rare high-grade neoplasm with poor prognosis. For advanced LMS with distant metastasis, the decision as to the choice of the most appropriate therapeutic strategy, including chemotherapy and surgery, is difficult. Here, we present an unusual case of LMS of the sigmoid colon with liver metastases and gastric cancer. The survival of this patient was prolonged by a combined modality therapy involving chemotherapy and surgery. A 66-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer and multiple liver metastases was referred to our hospital. The initial treatment with docetaxel and S-1 considerably reduced both the gastric cancer and liver tumors; consequently we performed surgical resection. Pathological examination revealed that no viable tumor cells remained in the stomach and chemotherapy resulted in complete remission of the gastric cancer. The liver tumors were immunohistochemically diagnosed as LMS. A tumor of the sigmoid colon was subsequently discovered and the liver tumors were found to have recurred. The surgically resected sigmoid colon and liver tumors were all immunohistochemically diagnosed as LMS. These findings indicated that the multiple liver metastases arose from the LMS in the sigmoid colon, and that they were accompanied by advanced gastric cancer. We performed another surgical resection and administered chemotherapy to treat the recurring liver metastases. The patient survived for 4 years and 10 months after initial presentation at our hospital. Colonic LMS is rare and its joint occurrence with gastric cancer is extremely unusual. Although LMS is a high-grade neoplasm, a multimodal therapeutic approach can increase patient survival time even when multiple liver metastases are present."
1,"The effects and mechanisms of Xiaoyao San on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease rat based on transcriptomics and proteomics analysis. Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is characterized by excessive lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and is closely associated with metabolic disturbances such as obesity, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance. Despite its increasing prevalence and potential progression to severe liver conditions, there is currently no approved pharmaceutical intervention for NAFLD. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulations, such as Xiaoyao San (XYS), have shown therapeutic efficacy in treating NAFLD, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study employed a multi-omics approach to elucidate the therapeutic mechanisms of XYS in NAFLD. A rat model of NAFLD was established using a high-fat diet (HFD). The chemical constituents of XYS were analyzed using UPLC-MS/MS. Transcriptomics and proteomics analyses were performed to identify potential biological targets and signaling pathways involved in the therapeutic effects of XYS. The results were validated using ELISA and Western blotting. UPLC-MS/MS identified 225 prototype chemical components of XYS in the blood. XYS significantly reduced body weight, liver index, and Lee's index in NAFLD model rats. It ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, down-regulated serum levels of ALT, AST, GGT, TG, TC, LDL-C, FBG, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and ROS, and up-regulated HDL-C levels. Transcriptomics and proteomics analyses revealed that XYS modulated key signaling pathways, including cAMP, TGF-β, NF-κB, and necroptosis. Specifically, XYS down-regulated the expressions of NF-κB, p-NF-κB, FOXO1, TGF-β1, RIP3, and p-MLKL, while up-regulating cAMP, PKA, p-PKA, and PPARα. XYS improves NAFLD by regulating the cAMP/PKA-mediated PPARα, FOXO1, and NF-κB signaling pathways. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of XYS in NAFLD and supports its potential as a novel therapeutic intervention for this condition."
1,"High intratumoral metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 expression predicts poor outcomes of cryoablation therapy for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma Cryoablation is one of the local therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but its safety and effect has not been studied in patients with Child class A or B and Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage C HCC. Metastasis-associated in colon cancer-1 (MACC1) overexpression has been associated with poor prognosis of HCC, but its predictive value to post-cryoablation outcomes remains unknown in patients with BCLC stage C HCC. This study assessed the safety and outcomes of cryoablation measured by time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS), and predictive value of MACC1 mRNA and protein overexpression in tumorous tissue to post-cryoablation outcomes in 120 advanced HCC patients with child-pugh class A or B by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical staining. The potenial correlation of MACC1 and c-Met expression to tumor cell proliferation and apoptosis was also analyzed. The cryoablation in patients with advanced unresectable HCC resulted in a median TTP and OS of 5.5 (4.2- 6.7) months and 10.5 (9.0-12.0) months, respectively and no significant complications, comparable to the historical report for RFA therapy. The MACC1 mRNA and nuclear protein expression was significantly increased in tumorous tissues in these patients than that in normal liver tissue controls. Higher expression of MACC1 mRNA and nuclear protein in tumorous tissues in these patients was associated with shorter post cryoablation median TTP and OS than that with lower MACC1 expression. Cryoablation is a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with advanced HCC and Child-pugh class A or B cirrhosis; and a higher intratumoral expression of MACC1 or nuclear translocation predicts poor outcomes of cryotherapy in these patients."

This study aimed to assess the proportion of HER2 positivity and its clinical implications in a large and well-characterized European GBC cohort. HER2 status was determined in 186 cases of surgically resected gallbladder adenocarcinoma and a subset of coexistent high-grade biliary intraepithelial neoplasia (BilIN, n = 74) in accordance with the up-to-date consensus for HER2 testing in gastric cancer by immunohistochemistry and dual-color chromogenic in situ hybridization. Positivity for HER2 was observed in 5.4% of all cases (n = 10). In those patients with concomitant high-grade BilIN, two of four positive samples also showed amplification in the precursor lesion, while in the two remaining cases, positivity was either confined to invasive tumor or high-grade BilIN, exclusively. Equivocal staining found in eleven cases was not accompanied by gene amplification. Staging of the HER2-positive group was significantly different from the HER2-negative group with most cases presenting at stage IV, paralleled by a trend towards decreased survival. One patient who received dual HER2 inhibition almost went into full clinical remission despite treatment initiation in a metastasized state. Our results reveal a low prevalence of HER2 positivity and highlight HER2 gene amplification as an early, potentially driving event in gallbladder carcinogenesis. Prospective standardized HER2 testing and randomized control studies are needed to prove clinical efficacy of targeted HER2 inhibition in GBC."
1,"Liver Cancer Etiology: Old Issues and New Perspectives. <AbstractText Label=""PURPOSE OF REVIEW"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">This review aims to synthesize the old issues and current understandings of the etiology of liver cancer, focusing on the diverse causative factors influenced by geographical, socioeconomic, and lifestyle variations across different regions.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RECENT FINDINGS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">We highlight significant geographic disparities in liver cancer risk factors. While hepatitis B and C viruses, aflatoxin exposure, and alcohol consumption remain globally established contributors; metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and metabolic syndromes are increasingly prominent in the West. Chronic HBV and aflatoxin continue to dominate as risk factors in Asia and Africa. Dietary factors, metabolic diseases like diabetes and obesity, genetic predispositions, environmental risk factors and lifestyle choices such as smoking and alcohol use play substantial roles in specific populations. Protective factors like coffee and tea consumption, along with aspirin use, vegetables and fruits have shown potential in reducing HCC risk, although findings vary by population and dietary habits. Liver cancer etiology is influenced by various factors that differ by region. Established risk factors include hepatitis B and C, aflatoxin, and alcohol. Emerging risks, such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, are more prevalent in Western countries, while aflatoxin and HBV remains significant in Asia and Africa. Diet, metabolic conditions like diabetes and obesity, genetic predispositions, and lifestyle choices also play crucial roles. Coffee, tea, aspirin, vegetables, and fruits may reduce HCC risk, but effectiveness varies. Future research should integrate epidemiology, genetics, and nutrition, with global cooperation and data sharing essential for effective cancer control strategies.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2024.

1,"Somatic mutations and clonal dynamics in healthy and cirrhotic human liver. The most common causes of chronic liver disease are excess alcohol intake, viral hepatitis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, with the clinical spectrum ranging in severity from hepatic inflammation to cirrhosis, liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The genome of HCC exhibits diverse mutational signatures, resulting in recurrent mutations across more than 30 cancer genes1-7. Stem cells from normal livers have a low mutational burden and limited diversity of signatures8, which suggests that the complexity of HCC arises during the progression to chronic liver disease and subsequent malignant transformation. Here, by sequencing whole genomes of 482 microdissections of 100-500 hepatocytes from 5 normal and 9 cirrhotic livers, we show that cirrhotic liver has a higher mutational burden than normal liver. Although rare in normal hepatocytes, structural variants, including chromothripsis, were prominent in cirrhosis. Driver mutations, such as point mutations and structural variants, affected 1-5% of clones. Clonal expansions of millimetres in diameter occurred in cirrhosis, with clones sequestered by the bands of fibrosis that surround regenerative nodules. Some mutational signatures were universal and equally active in both non-malignant hepatocytes and HCCs; some were substantially more active in HCCs than chronic liver disease; and others-arising from exogenous exposures-were present in a subset of patients. The activity of exogenous signatures between adjacent cirrhotic nodules varied by up to tenfold within each patient, as a result of clone-specific and microenvironmental forces. Synchronous HCCs exhibited the same mutational signatures as background cirrhotic liver, but with higher burden. Somatic mutations chronicle the exposures, toxicity, regeneration and clonal structure of liver tissue as it progresses from health to disease."
1,"Autophagy-dependent generation of Axin2+ cancer stem-like cells promotes hepatocarcinogenesis in liver cirrhosis. Autophagy is a pathophysiological phenomenon in liver cirrhosis that can further progress into hepatocarcinoma. Liver cancer stem cells (CSCs) are believed to initiate hepatocarcinogenesis. To investigate the precise mechanism related to the origin of CSCs in liver cirrhosis and hepatocarcinogenesis, we labeled Axin2+ hepatic cells with EGFP in Axin2Cre;Rosa26EGFP transgenic rats, and then stratified clinical and rat liver cirrhosis samples by autophagy flux. Clinical follow-up and lineage tracing in transgenic rat liver cirrhosis revealed that while Axin2/EGFP+ hepatic cells were present in normal livers and cirrhotic livers without aberrant autophagy, hepatic Axin2/EGFP+CD90+ cells were generated exclusively in cirrhotic livers with aberrant autophagy and promoted hepatocarcinogenesis. Aberrant autophagy in liver cirrhosis resulted in hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) expression, leading to activation of Met/JNK and Met/STAT3 signaling in sorted hepatic Axin2/EGFP+ cells and their transition into Axin2/EGFP+CD90+ cells that possess CSC properties. In a transgenic rat liver cirrhosis model, induction or inhibition of autophagy in cirrhotic livers by systemic administration of rapamycin or chloroquine or transfection with Atg3- and Atg7-shRNAs significantly induced or suppressed HGF expression, which in turn increased or reduced generation of EGFP+CD90+ hepatic cells by activating or inactivating Met/JNK and Met/STAT3 signaling, thereby promoting or preventing hepatocarcinogenesis. Systemic treatment with HGF-shRNA, SP600125 or stattic also reduced generation of EGFP(Axin2)+ hepatic cell-originated CD90+ CSCs in aberrant autophagic cirrhotic livers by inactivating HGF/Met/JNK or HGF/Met/STAT3 signaling, further preventing hepatocarcinogenesis. These data suggest that activation of Met/JNK and Met/STAT3 signaling in Axin2+ hepatic cells via autophagy-dependent HGF expression and the resultant generation of Axin2+CD90+ CSCs is a major mechanism of hepatocarcinogenesis in cirrhotic livers."

1,"Imaging features of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma in gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a rare malignancy occurring in young patients without cirrhosis. Objectives of our study were to analyze contrast material uptake in hepatobiliary phase imaging (HBP) in gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI in patients with FLC and to characterize imaging features in sequence techniques other than HBP. In this retrospective study on histology-proven FLC, contrast material uptake in HBP was quantitatively assessed by calculating the corrected FLC enhancement index (CEI) using mean signal intensities of FLC and lumbar muscle on pre-contrast imaging and HBP, respectively. Moreover, enhancement patterns in dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and relative signal intensities compared with background liver parenchyma were determined by two radiologists in consensus for HBP, diffusion-weighted imaging using high b-values (DWI), and T2 and T1 weighted pre-contrast imaging. In 6 of 13 patients with FLC gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI was available. The CEI suggested presence of HBP contrast material uptake in all FLCs. A mean CEI of 1.35 indicated FLC signal increase of 35% in HBP compared with pre-contrast imaging. All FLCs were hypointense in HBP compared with background liver parenchyma. Three of 6 FLCs had arterial hyperenhancement and venous wash-out. In DWI and T2 weighted imaging, 5 of 6 FLCs were hyperintense. In T1 weighted imaging, 5 of 6 FLCs were hypointense. Hepatobiliary uptake of gadoxetic acid was quantitatively measurable in all FLCs investigated in our study. The observation of hypointensity of FLCs in HBP compared with background liver parenchyma emphasizes the role of gadoxetic acid-enhanced liver MRI for non-invasive diagnosis of FLC and its importance in the diagnostic work-up of indeterminate liver lesions."
1,"A regression-based model for predicting the best mode of treatment for Egyptian liver cancer patients Liver cancer is one of the main causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Due to the extreme heterogeneity of this disease, its prognosis and management are still not yet standardized. Different treatment modalities are available. However, the patient’s response to each of them varies. Therefore, it is critical to establish a model to help physicians individualize the management of this aggressive tumor. This paper presents one of the first investigations into personalizing liver cancer treatment for patients with genotype 4 using their clinical and genetic data. In this study, we analyzed the data of 1427 Egyptian patients with liver cancer who were either treated by one of five different treatment methods or not treated. We proposed and compared between two pipelines, a Single-Model pipeline and a Multi-Model pipeline, for analyzing the patient’s clinical and genetic data to recommend the best liver cancer treatment and, therefore, potentially improve their prognosis. We studied the performance of six regression methods in predicting the outcome of the treatment modalities for liver cancer patients. The best performing method was used in building the models in the proposed pipelines. Our results show a difference in performance among different regression models, which proves the importance of choosing an appropriate one in decision-making, especially when dealing with important issues such as liver cancer treatment recommendations. In our analysis, we also prove the crucial importance of genetic data and their effect on patients’ prognosis and response to treatment. Finally, this study signifies the great potential that data-mining methods could have in improving healthcare especially for serious diseases such as liver cancer."

1,"Immunological distinctions between nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common cause of chronic liver disease, ranges from simple hepatic steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is a more aggressive form characterized by hepatocyte injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. Increasing evidence suggests that NASH is a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which is the fifth most common cancer worldwide and the second most common cause of cancer-related death. Recent studies support a strong mechanistic link between the NASH microenvironment and HCC development. The liver has a large capacity to remove circulating pathogens and gut-derived microbial compounds. Thus, the liver is a central player in immunoregulation. Altered immune responses are tightly associated with the development of NASH and HCC. The objective of this study was to differentiate the roles of specific immune cell subsets in NASH and HCC pathogenesis. Clarifying the role of specific cells in the immune system in the transition from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to liver cancer will help to understand disease progression and may open avenues towards new preventive and therapeutic strategies. NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease. Growing evidence suggests that its most aggressive form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), can promote the development of liver cancer, the second most common cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Chang-Woo Lee and colleagues at Sungkyunkwan University, Suwon, South Korea review the immunological distinction between NASH and liver cancer, focusing on the levels and activities of six key types of immune system cells. Chronic inflammation mediated by the immune system can create conditions for NAFLD, NASH and liver cancer to develop and worsen."
1,"PDXliver: a database of liver cancer patient derived xenograft mouse models Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths and characterized by heterogeneity and drug resistance. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models have been widely used in cancer research because they reproduce the characteristics of original tumors. However, the current studies of liver cancer PDX mice are scattered and the number of available PDX models are too small to represent the heterogeneity of liver cancer patients. To improve this situation and to complement available PDX models related resources, here we constructed a comprehensive database, PDXliver, to integrate and analyze liver cancer PDX models. Currently, PDXliver contains 116 PDX models from Chinese liver cancer patients, 51 of them were established by the in-house PDX platform and others were curated from the public literatures. These models are annotated with complete information, including clinical characteristics of patients, genome-wide expression profiles, germline variations, somatic mutations and copy number alterations. Analysis of expression subtypes and mutated genes show that PDXliver represents the diversity of human patients. Another feature of PDXliver is storing drug response data of PDX mice, which makes it possible to explore the association between molecular profiles and drug sensitivity. All data can be accessed via the Browse and Search pages. Additionally, two tools are provided to interactively visualize the omics data of selected PDXs or to compare two groups of PDXs. As far as we known, PDXliver is the first public database of liver cancer PDX models. We hope that this comprehensive resource will accelerate the utility of PDX models and facilitate liver cancer research. The PDXliver database is freely available online at: http://www.picb.ac.cn/PDXliver/"
1,"Adjuvant internal radiation therapy in a model of colorectal cancer-derived hepatic metastases Selective internal radiation therapy (SIR therapy) is a technique whereby metastatic liver cancer is irradiated by embolising microspheres containing the radionuclide yttrium-90 into the hepatic arterial circulation. To date this technique has not been used as an adjuvant therapy, but rather to treat established metastases in the liver. This study evaluated the use of two intrahepatic radiation doses delivered on radioactive microspheres for the treatment of small, growing micrometastases. Three groups of five rats were each inoculated with tumour spheroids into the portal vein. The resultant liver micrometastases were treated with either 10 or 20 MBq of yttrium-90 microspheres or a sham dose of non-radioactive microspheres injected into the portal vein 2 days following tumour inoculation. The livers of each animal were examined for the presence of metastases after a further 21 days and liver function tests were performed. At the time of sacrifice there was no obvious normal liver damage in any of the rats treated with microspheres. The livers of the sham-treated animals contained extensive signs of tumour deposition. A mean of 34 tumours were taken from the livers of each of the sham-treated animals, whereas only a single tumour was found in one animal treated with 10 MBq of yttrium and eight small tumours from two animals treated with 20 MBq. Liver function tests demonstrated a significant short-term increase in alkaline phosphatase levels in the radiation-treated animals compared with shams, but there were no other indications of any effects on liver function. These results indicate a potential role for SIR therapy in an adjuvant setting with colorectal cancer."
1,"Incidence and mortality of liver cancer in China in 2011 Liver cancer is a common cancer with poor prognosis in China. In this study, the national population-based cancer registration data were used to evaluate and analyze liver cancer incidence and mortality in China in 2011 and provide a reference for liver cancer prevention and control. We collected and evaluated the incidence and mortality data of liver cancer in 2011 from 177 cancer registries with qualified data. These data were used in the final analysis including calculating crude, standardized, and truncated incidences and mortalities, and estimated new liver cancer cases and deaths using age-specific rates and the corresponding populations. The national census in 2000 and Segi’s population were used for age-standardized rates. The estimates of new liver cancer cases and deaths were 355,595 and 322,416, respectively, in China in 2011. The crude incidence, age-standardized rate of incidence by Chinese standard population (ASRIC), and age-standardized rate of incidence by world standard population (ASRIW) of liver cancer were 26.39/100,000, 19.48/100,000, and 19.10/100,000, respectively; the crude mortality, age-standardized rate of mortality by Chinese standard population (ASRMC), and age-standardized rate of mortality by world standard population (ASRMW) of liver cancer were 23.93/100,000,17.48/100,000, and 17.17/100,000, respectively. The incidence and mortality were higher in rural areas than in urban areas and higher in males than in females. The age-specific incidence and mortality of liver cancer increased greatly with age, particularly after 30 years and peaked at 80–84 or 85+ years. Liver cancer is a common cancer in China, particularly for males and residents in rural areas. Targeted prevention, early detection, and treatment programs should be carried out."
1,"Differential motility stimulation but not growth stimulation or adhesion of metastatic human colorectal carcinoma cells by target organ-derived liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. Liver is the most common distant metastatic site for colorectal cancers and when blood-borne colorectal cancer cells reach the liver, they first encounter hepatic capillary and sinusoidal endothelial cells. Thus we studied differences between highly (HT-29LMM) and poorly (HT-29P) liver-metastatic sublines of human colorectal cancer cells by examining the interactions between tumor cells and liver microvessel endothelial cells. Using hepatic sinusoidal endothelial (HSE) and lung microvessel endothelial (MLE) cell-conditioned medium we measured the growth and motility stimulating activities released from these endothelial cells and adhesion of these cancer cells to the endothelial cells. Differences in the ability of HSE-conditioned medium (HSE-CM) or MLE-conditioned medium (MLE-CM) to stimulate HT-29 cell growth were not observed. There was a small but significant increase in the rate of adhesion of highly metastatic HT-29LMM cells to HSE cell monolayers than poorly metastatic HT-29P cells, but there was no difference in adhesion to MLE cell monolayers. HSE-CM stimulated the motility of highly metastatic colorectal cancer cells to a greater extent than the poorly metastatic cells. Motility-stimulating activity for the colorectal cancer cell lines was not detected in MLE-CM. The HSE-CM motility-stimulating activity for human HT-29 cells was not removed using antibodies against hepatocyte growth factor (HGF/SF), complement component C3 or laminin, indicating that it is not related to these known liver-derived motility factors. The results suggest that the ability of highly metastatic HT-29LMM colorectal cancer cells to colonize the liver is related to their ability to respond to liver sinusoidal endothelial cell-derived motility factors and to a lesser degree to adhere to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells."

1,"Qualitative and quantitative variations in liver function thresholds among clinical trials in cancer: a need for harmonization. The liver is critically involved in drug metabolism pathways and the potential for hepatic toxicity is significant with specific cancer therapeutics. Variations in the definition of liver function thresholds that may generate heterogeneity of toxicity and efficacy outcomes across therapeutics trials in cancer require assessment. A random sample of therapeutic trials in cancer (n = 500, general category), trials using hepatotoxic drugs (abiraterone, pazopanib: n = 181), trials using drugs metabolized by the liver (doxorubicin, vincristine: n = 606), and therapeutic trials in hepatic dysfunction (n = 49) were each identified on clinicaltrials.gov. Definitions of liver function thresholds and their distribution were collated and categorized in each group. A third of all trials listed on clinicaltrials.gov across the four categories failed to provide an explicit definition of liver function. Among trials with an explicit definition, a combination of bilirubin and transaminase levels was used in 33–64%, whereas a miscellaneous combination of definitions (in the general category consisting of 11 unique liver function parameters creating 17 unique combinations) was used 29–58% of the time across the four categories of studies. The Child–Pugh or National Cancer Institute Organ Dysfunction Working Group (NCI-ODWG) criteria were rarely employed (0–12% studies). Allowance for Gilbert’s disease in bilirubin thresholds was identified in only 6–23% studies and for liver metastases in 2–15% of studies. There is a marked heterogeneity in the liver function definitions used across cancer clinical trials even when the potential for drug toxicity and altered drug metabolism is significant. Harmonization of criteria will streamline eligibility and mitigate variations in key outcomes across trials."
1,"Criteria for liver resection for metastasis from bile duct cancer The surgical indications for liver metastasis from bile duct cancer remain contentious, because surgery is generally thought unlikely to improve survival. However, recent reports show that long-term survival has been achieved with liver resection of metastasis from recurrent bile duct cancer in selected patients. Liver resection for liver metastasis from bile duct cancer was proposed only when the following criteria were met: liver-only metastasis, a solitary tumor, and no increase in the number of lesions during 3 months of observation. This study aimed to validate our criteria and to analyze which factors impact on survival. Between 2003 and 2017, 164 patients underwent pathologically curative resection for bile duct cancer. Recurrence developed in 98 of these patients, as liver-only metastasis in 25. Eleven of these 25 patients underwent liver resection (liver resection group), and 14 did not (non-liver resection group). The median overall survival was longer in the liver resection group than in all the patients (44 months vs. 17.8 months, respectively p = 0.040). The median overall survival was better in the liver resection group than in the non-liver resection group (44 months vs. 19.9 months, p = 0.012). The disease-free interval was also significantly longer in the liver resection group than in the non-liver resection group [22 months (range; 4–34 months) vs. 3 months (2–11), p < 0.001]. Potentially, metachronous solitary liver metastasis from bile duct cancer is an indication for liver resection when the patient has had a long disease-free interval. Observation for 3 months from first detection of metastasis may optimize the selection for this surgery."

The heterogeneity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in cellular level is not clear.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Integration analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data and spatial transcriptomics data was performed. Multiple methods were applied to investigate the subtype of HCC tumor cells. The functional characteristics, translation factors, clinical implications and microenvironment associations of different subtypes of tumor cells were analyzed. The interaction of subtype and fibroblasts were analyzed.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">We established a heterogeneity landscape of HCC malignant cells by integrated 52 single-cell RNA sequencing data and 5 spatial transcriptomics data. We identified three subtypes in tumor cells, including ARG1<sup>+</sup> metabolism subtype (Metab-subtype), TOP2A<sup>+</sup> proliferation phenotype (Prol-phenotype), and S100A6<sup>+</sup> pro-metastatic subtype (EMT-subtype). Enrichment analysis found that the three subtypes harbored different features, that is metabolism, proliferating, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Trajectory analysis revealed that both Metab-subtype and EMT-subtype originated from the Prol-phenotype. Translation factor analysis found that EMT-subtype showed exclusive activation of SMAD3 and TGF-β signaling pathway. HCC dominated by EMT-subtype cells harbored an unfavorable prognosis and a deserted microenvironment. We uncovered a positive loop between tumor cells and fibroblasts mediated by SPP1-CD44 and CCN2/TGF-β-TGFBR1 interaction pairs. Inhibiting CCN2 disrupted the loop, mitigated the transformation to EMT-subtype, and suppressed metastasis.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">By establishing a heterogeneity landscape of malignant cells, we identified a three-subtype classification in HCC. Among them, S100A6<sup>+</sup> tumor cells play a crucial role in metastasis.

1,"Cancer incidence near municipal solid waste incinerators in Great Britain. By use of the postcoded database held by the Small Area Health Statistic Unit, cancer incidence of over 14 million people living near 72 municipal solid waste incinerators in Great Britain was examined from 1974-86 (England), 1974-84 (Wales) and 1975-87 (Scotland). Numbers of observed cases were compared with expected numbers calculated from national rates (regionally adjusted) after stratification by a deprivation index based on 1981 census small area statistics. Observed-expected ratios were tested for decline in risk with distance up to 7.5 km. The study was conducted in two stages: the first involved a stratified random sample of 20 incinerators; the second the remaining 52 incinerators. Over the two stages of the study was a statistically significant (P<0.05) decline in risk with distance from incinerators for all cancers combined, stomach, colorectal, liver and lung cancer. Among these cancers in the second stage, the excess from 0 to 1 km ranged from 37% for liver cancer (0.95) excess cases 10(-5) per year to 5% for colorectal cancer. There was evidence of residual confounding near the incinerators, which seems to be a likely explanation of the finding for all cancers, stomach and lung, and also to explain at least part of the excess of liver cancer. For this reason and because of a substantial level of misdiagnosis (mainly secondary tumours) found among registrations and death certificates for liver cancer, further investigation, including histological review of the cases, is to be done to help determine whether or not there is an increase in primary liver cancer in the vicinity of incinerators."
1,"Development of a deep pathomics score for predicting hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after liver transplantation. <AbstractText Label=""BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">Tumor recurrence after liver transplantation (LT) impedes the curative chance for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients.

Residual convolutional neural networks were used to identify six histological structures of HCC. The individual risk score of each structure and DPS were derived by a modified DeepSurv network. Cox regression analysis and Concordance index were used to evaluate the prognostic significance. The cellular exploration of prognostic immune biomarkers was performed by quantitative and spatial proximity analysis according to three panels of 7-color immunofluorescence.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The overall classification accuracy of HCC tissue was 97%. At the structural level, immune cells were the most significant tissue category for predicting post-LT recurrence (HR 1.907, 95% CI 1.490-2.440). The C-indices of DPS achieved 0.827 and 0.794 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. Multivariate analysis for recurrence-free survival (RFS) showed that DPS (HR 4.795, 95% CI 3.017-7.619) was an independent risk factor. Patients in the high-risk subgroup had a shorter RFS, larger tumor diameter and a lower proportion of clear tumor borders. At the cellular level, a higher infiltration of intratumoral NK cells was negatively correlated with recurrence risk.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">This study established an effective DPS.

1,"Incidence, clinical risk and prognostic factors for liver metastasis in patients with cervical cancer: a population-based retrospective study. Cervical cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies in women, particularly metastasis resulting in a poor prognosis. However, the clinical characteristics of cervical cancer patients with advanced liver metastasis have not been well investigated. We aimed to evaluate the incidence, clinical risk and prognostic factors for hepatic metastasis in cervical cancer patients. The clinical features of patients diagnosed with cervical cancer were collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Result (SEER) public cancer database between 2010 and 2015. Multivariate logistic and Cox regression models were performed to identify potential risk and prognostic factors for liver metastasis in patients with cervical cancer. A total of 431 patients (2.32%) developed liver metastasis in our analysis. The following characteristics were significantly associated with the development of liver metastasis: black ethnicity, uninsured status, higher tumor stage, poorer differentiated grade, non-squamous histology, non-surgery of primary site, patients with any additional lung, bone, and brain metastasis. Multivariate Cox regression showed that patients with additional lung metastasis, without radiotherapy, and without chemotherapy were negatively correlated with overall survival. Concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy was a favorable prognostic factor to improve overall survival, and chemotherapy showed to increase cause-specific survival. Additional lung metastasis was an independent characteristic for both risk and prognostic factors for hepatic metastasis in patients with cervical cancer. Our results found several potential clinical features that may be used to assess the risk and prognosis of liver metastasis in patients with cervical cancer. These associated factors may provide clinical indications for the early identification and treatment of cervical cancer patients with hepatic metastasis."
1,"Toripalimab combined with lenvatinib and GEMOX is a promising regimen as first-line treatment for advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: a single-center, single-arm, phase 2 study. Advanced intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) has a dismal prognosis. Here, we report the efficacy and safety of combining toripalimab, lenvatinib, and gemcitabine plus oxaliplatin (GEMOX) as first-line therapy for advanced ICC. Thirty patients with pathologically confirmed advanced ICC received intravenous gemcitabine (1 g/m<sup>2</sup>) on Days 1 and 8 and oxaliplatin (85 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) Q3W for six cycles along with intravenous toripalimab (240 mg) Q3W and oral lenvatinib (8 mg) once daily for one year. The expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) and genetic status was investigated in paraffin-embedded tissues using immunohistochemistry and whole-exome sequencing (WES) analysis. The primary endpoint was the objective response rate (ORR). Secondary outcomes included safety, overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease control rate (DCR) and duration of response (DoR). As of July 1, 2022, the median follow-up time was 23.5 months, and the ORR was 80%. Twenty-three patients achieved partial response, and one achieved complete response. Patients (21/30) with DNA damage response (DDR)-related gene mutations showed a higher ORR, while patients (14/30) with tumor area positivity ≥1 (PD-L1 staining) showed a trend of high ORR, but without significant difference. The median OS, PFS, and DoR were 22.5, 10.2, and 11.0 months, respectively. The DCR was 93.3%. Further, 56.7% of patients experienced manageable grade ≥3 adverse events (AEs), commonly neutropenia (40.0%) and leukocytopenia (23.3%). In conclusion, toripalimab plus lenvatinib and GEMOX are promising first-line regimens for the treatment of advanced ICC. A phase-III, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized study to validate our findings was approved by the National Medical Products Administration (NMPA, No. 2021LP01825).Trial registration Clinical trials: NCT03951597."
1,"Icaritin suppresses CAD-mediated liver cancer development by targeting miR-18b-5p in a xenograft mouse model. Cancer cells show abnormal nucleotide metabolism and prefer the de novo synthesis pathway. As the key enzymes, Carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase 2, Aspartate transcarbamoylase, and Dihydroorotase (CAD) is overactivated in cancer and promotes pyrimidine de novo synthesis, supplying cancer cells with DNA and RNA biosynthesis precursors. Therefore, the development of drugs targeting CAD might inhibit cancer progression and transformation. Icaritin (ICT) is an isoprenoid flavonoid derivative with a wide range of anticancer activities, however, the mechanism of ICT in regulating pyrimidine biosynthesis in cancer remains unclear. MicroRNAs are involved in carcinogenesis by regulating the expression of target genes, and ICT has been shown to regulate the expression of miRNAs leading to suppressing cancer progression. Using both human normal hepatocytes and liver cancer cells, we found that CAD expression was significantly elevated in cancer cells. Interestingly, although ICT treatment reduced CAD protein levels in liver cancer cells, it increased CAD transcriptional activity. Dual-luciferase reporter assays confirmed miR-18b-5p as a direct regulator of CAD. By transfecting miR-18b-5p mimics or inhibitors, we showed ICT upregulates miR-18b-5p to suppress CAD, inhibiting liver cancer cell proliferation, migration, and colony formation. Furthermore, in a human liver cancer xenograft mouse model, ICT treatment markedly reduced tumor growth and decreased Ki-67 expression, consistent with the in vitro results, CAD protein expression was downregulated, while its mRNA level was upregulated, further supporting a post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism. Overall, ICT plays an anti-liver cancer role by increasing miR-18b-5p at the post-transcriptional level to inhibit CAD expression, which may interfere with the de novo synthesis of pyrimidine and development of liver cancer."

1,"Intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: report of 272 patients compared with 5,829 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma To clarify clinicopathologic differences between patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and identify potential factors influencing survival after hepatectomy for ICC. Comparison of clinicopathologic data was made between patients who underwent hepatectomy for ICC (n = 272) and HCC (n = 5,829) during the same period. Twenty-five clinicopathologic variables were selected for univariate and multivariate analyses to evaluate their influence on prognosis of ICC. Compared with patients with HCC, ICC patients were more common in females and more elderly, had a lower proportion of asymptomatic tumors, lower serum alpha-fetoprotein, higher serum carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19–9 and alkaline phosphatase levels; lower incidence of hepatitis history, associated cirrhosis and serum hepatitis B surface antigen; lower proportion of small tumors, well-encapsulated tumors and tumor emboli in the portal vein; higher proportion of single tumor, perihila lymph node involvement and poor differentiation; and less frequency of limited resection (all, P < 0.0001). Distant metastasis was less frequent in patients with ICC (P = 0.027). A total of 5-years overall and disease-free survival (in brackets) after resection was 26.4% (13.1%) and 44.5% (33.1%) (P < 0.0001, P < 0.0001) for patients with ICC and HCC, respectively. Factors influencing survival after resection of ICC can be divided mainly into two categories: early detection of asymptomatic ICC (P < 0.0001) and curative resection (P = 0.002). ICC Patients have distinct clinicopathologic features as compared with HCC patients. Surgery remains the only effective treatment for ICC. Early detection of asymptomatic ICC and curative resection were the key to achieve optimal survival."
1,"Circular RNA circMET drives immunosuppression and anti-PD1 therapy resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma via the miR-30-5p/snail/DPP4 axis Amplification of chromosome 7q21-7q31 is associated with tumor recurrence and multidrug resistance, and several genes in this region are powerful drivers of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We aimed to investigate the key circular RNAs (circRNAs) in this region that regulate the initiation and development of HCC. We used qRT-PCR to assess the expression of 43 putative circRNAs in this chromosomal region in human HCC and matched nontumor tissues. In addition, we used cultured HCC cells to modify circRNA expression and assessed the effects in several cell-based assays as well as gene expression analyses via RNA-seq. Modified cells were implanted into immunocompetent mice to assess the effects on tumor development. We performed additional experiments to determine the mechanism of action of these effects. circMET (hsa_circ_0082002) was overexpressed in HCC tumors, and circMET expression was associated with survival and recurrence in HCC patients. By modifying the expression of circMET in HCC cells in vitro, we found that circMET overexpression promoted HCC development by inducing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition and enhancing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Mechanistically, circMET induced this microenvironment through the miR-30-5p/Snail/ dipeptidyl peptidase 4(DPP4)/CXCL10 axis. In addition, the combination of the DPP4 inhibitor sitagliptin and anti-PD1 antibody improved antitumor immunity in immunocompetent mice. Clinically, HCC tissues from diabetic patients receiving sitagliptin showed higher CD8+ T cell infiltration than those from HCC patients with diabetes without sitagliptin treatment. circMET is an onco-circRNA that induces HCC development and immune tolerance via the Snail/DPP4/CXCL10 axis. Furthermore, sitagliptin may enhance the efficacy of anti-PD1 therapy in a subgroup of patients with HCC."
